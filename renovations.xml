        <![CDATA[<p><strong>When you're designing a room in your home, always begin by asking yourself three simple things: What will you be doing in the room? When will you be doing it? And how do you want to feel in the space? </strong></p><p>Having the answers to these questions stopped me making the wrong decisions when it came to decorating our family <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/bathroom/g44649597/small-bathroom-ideas/" target="_blank">bathroom</a>. </p><p>We have a separate shower room with a WC, and as a family we are out of the splashy toddler years, so this room is for brushing teeth in the mornings and having a long soak in the tub in the evenings. Keeping these factors in mind allowed me to approach designing this room in a different way than I would otherwise have done. </p><p>I intentionally avoided the gleaming, clinical feel of an all-tiled white bathroom and instead approached the design as I would a living room. Colourful wallpaper, soft fabrics, <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/walls/a44839401/sophie-robinson-displaying-art/" target="_blank">paintings</a> and decorative lighting are not things you necessarily expect in a bathroom but they can work brilliantly. </p><p><a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/bathroom/g38915455/bathroom-tile-ideas/" target="_blank">Tiles</a>, while practical in very wet areas, can feel hard and cold and are acoustically noisy, so I substituted them for engineered wood flooring, and splashbacks behind the basin and bath are in painted bathroom-grade tongue-and-groove panelling.  </p><img alt="Sophie avoided the gleaming feel of an all-tiled white bathroom and instead approached the design as she would a living room" caption="Sophie avoided the gleaming feel of an all-tiled white bathroom and instead approached the design as she would a living room" credit="ALUN CALLENDER" height="1761" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sophie-robinson-bathroom-decorating-tips-bathroom-shot-64de2ab50135f.jpeg" title="sophie-robinson-bathroom-decorating-tips-bathroom-shot.jpeg" width="2640"><p>And wallpaper! Yes, you can have wallpaper in your bathroom if the room is well ventilated. Just keep it away from wet areas, such as shower cubicles and splashbacks. Apply a coat of decorator's matt varnish to protect it from moisture damage, and it can last for years.</p><blockquote align="left" class="pullquote">Yes, you can have wallpaper in your bathroom!</blockquote><p>My aim was to create a cosy feel, which I achieved by accessorising with a fluffy Moroccan rug and <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/g42531857/best-rattan-furniture/" target="_blank">rattan furniture</a> as well as an antique foxed mirror and plenty of plants. A vintage oil painting picked up for peanuts at an <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/looks/a44354026/sophie-robinson-vintage-shopping/" target="_blank">antiques fair</a>, and my grandmother’s collection of plates all add to the charm. </p><p>A palette of cream, brick red and mustard yellow creates a feeling of warmth, and I even painted the outside of the bath myself, which is easy to do with an all-surface primer applied first. </p><p>All in all, everyone loves this room and three years on it's still looking picture perfect. And best of all, it has a lock on the door, making it my favourite place to escape to, take time out and relax. </p><p><strong>Sign up to Sophie's online course, <em><a href="https://courses.sophierobinson.co.uk/courses/be-your-own-interior-designer" target="_blank">Be your own interior designer</a>.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Follow House Beautiful on </em></strong><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@housebeautifuluk" target="_blank"><strong><em>TikTok</em></strong></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/housebeautifuluk/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Instagram</em></strong></a><strong><em>. </em></strong></p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p class="body-text"><strong>Once a baby's nursery, this light and airy bathroom now provides a serene space for the parents. Pared-back yet glamorous, with subtle Art Deco references, it's a masterclass in simple sophistication.  </strong></p><h2 class="body-h2">Who lives here</h2><p>Maria Emerson and her husband Tom live with their young daughter in a Victorian house in Putney, south-west London.</p><h2 class="body-h2">Before</h2><p><strong>ME:</strong> The room adjoins our main bedroom and used to be our daughter's nursery, but now she's a little older she's happy in a larger room upstairs. Originally the doorway was on the other side of the room.</p><img alt="The room was previously their daughter’s nursery" caption="The room was previously their daughter’s nursery" credit="Simple Bathrooms" height="1024" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/luxy-but-laid-back-bathroom-renovation-putney-london-before-64f9bbca05622.jpeg" title="luxy-but-laid-back-bathroom-renovation-putney-london-before.jpeg" width="768"><h4 class="body-h4">Tell us about your plans for this room... </h4><p><strong>ME:</strong> Our aim was to create a functional, modern space with a glamorous look. It was important to us that we add lots of warmth and texture, and we tried to give a nod to Art Deco style, and even had in mind the grandeur of ancient Greece. The wooden fluting makes it feel elegant while still being perfectly practical. </p><h4 class="body-h4">How did you get started? </h4><p><strong>ME: </strong>We enlisted the help of specialist design company <a href="https://www.simplybathroomsltd.co.uk/" target="_blank">Simply Bathrooms</a> in Surrey for the planning. It offered a full design service and created 3D visual plans, so we knew what the layout would look like. Having renovated a bathroom in our previous home, this time we wanted extra specialist support! </p><img alt="The walk-in shower feels both bright and warm, while shelves fitted into a narrow niche are a practical option" caption="The walk-in shower feels both bright and warm, while shelves fitted into a narrow niche are a practical option" credit="Simple Bathrooms" height="5472" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/luxy-but-laid-back-bathroom-renovation-putney-london-64f9bbcaa297c.jpeg" title="luxy-but-laid-back-bathroom-renovation-putney-london.jpeg" width="3648"><h4 class="body-h4">Did you have to overcome any hurdles? </h4><p><strong>ME:</strong> Deciding on the best layout proved tricky. The room is a good size, but the position of the chimney breast limited our options. We wanted a large vanity unit, bath and walk-in shower, so had to be clever about maximising space. This meant moving the doorway and installing a sliding door – and we went for a smaller-than-full-size tub. The bath looks stylish without taking up much room, and we can enjoy the garden view while having a soak. </p><h4 class="body-h4">What were your must-haves? </h4><p><strong>ME: </strong>It was all about how the space made us feel. We wanted to ignore trends and come up with something unique and timeless that felt distinctly ours. For example, the <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/bathroom/g38915455/bathroom-tile-ideas/" target="_blank">terrazzo</a> countertop basins are not an obvious choice, but they make the room feel more individual and eclectic. </p><img alt="With a bold terrazzo finish, these designs make a statement in the otherwise neutral space" caption="With a bold terrazzo finish, these designs make a statement in the otherwise neutral space" credit="Simple Bathrooms" height="5472" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/luxy-but-laid-back-bathroom-renovation-putney-london-plants-sink-64f9bd0697697.jpeg" title="luxy-but-laid-back-bathroom-renovation-putney-london-plants-sink.jpeg" width="3648"><h4 class="body-h4">Are you happy with the final result? </h4><p><strong>ME: </strong>Very much so. We're obsessed with the <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/renovate/diy/a35288060/how-to-panel-wall/" target="_blank">wooden panelling</a>, which elevates the room, but the wall tiles are the real unsung heroes. We wanted something neutral that looked smart but not clinical, so were happy to find these ones from Ca' Pietra in a mix of white and warmer off-white tones. The textured surface looks handmade, but they're super-practical, easy-to-clean porcelain. We've got exactly the modern bathroom we wanted.</p><img alt="Oak panels by the bath hide the old chimney breast" caption="Oak panels by the bath hide the old chimney breast" credit="Simple Bathrooms" height="5472" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/luxy-but-laid-back-bathroom-renovation-putney-london-bath-64f9bd06a3f2d.jpeg" title="luxy-but-laid-back-bathroom-renovation-putney-london-bath.jpeg" width="3648"><h2 class="body-h2">Sourcebook<br></h2><ul><li>Slipp bath, <a href="https://bcdesigns.co.uk/" target="_blank">bcdesigns.co.uk</a>. </li><li>Vos bath mixer tap, basin valves & spout, shower head & towel rails; all <a href="https://www.jtpuk.co.uk/" target="_blank">jtpuk.co.uk</a>.</li><li>Gallery 10 shower screen, <a href="https://www.crosswater.co.uk/" target="_blank">crosswater.co.uk</a>. </li><li>Uni WC, <a href="https://saneux.com/" target="_blank">saneux.com</a>. </li><li>Docklands rectangular mirrors, <a href="https://originsliving.uk/" target="_blank">originsliving.uk</a>. </li><li>Terrazzo basin, vanity unit & fluted oak wall panelling; all <a href="https://www.simplybathroomsltd.co.uk/" target="_blank">simplybathroomsltd.co.uk</a>. </li><li>Wall lights, <a href="https://www.pooky.com/" target="_blank">pooky.com</a>. </li><li>Metro wall tiles & Louvre floor tiles; both <a href="https://capietra.com/" target="_blank">capietra.com.</a> </li><li>Walls in Mizzle matt emulsion, <a href="https://www.farrow-ball.com/" target="_blank">farrow-ball.com</a></li></ul><h2 class="body-h2">Costs</h2><ul><li>Bath <strong>£1,986 </strong></li><li>Bath tap<strong> £950 </strong></li><li>Shower <strong>£1,203 </strong></li><li>Basin taps<strong> £658 </strong></li><li>Towel rails<strong> £718 </strong></li><li>Shower screen<strong> £827 </strong></li><li>WC<strong> £788 </strong></li><li>Basins<strong> £500 </strong></li><li>Vanity unit<strong> £2,779 </strong></li><li>Lights<strong> £216 </strong></li><li>Tiles <strong>£2,000 </strong></li><li>Mirrors <strong>£350 </strong></li><li>Oak panelling<strong> £2,000 </strong></li><li>Paint <strong>£68 </strong></li><li><strong>TOTAL £15,043</strong></li></ul><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong><em>Follow House Beautiful on </em></strong><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@housebeautifuluk" target="_blank"><strong><em>TikTok</em></strong></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/housebeautifuluk/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Instagram</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></strong></p><p></p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p class="body-text"><strong>This elegant pink bathroom, complete with brushed-brass finishes, is unrecognisable thanks to a total revamp. Complete with clever <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/a35901813/alcove-ideas/" target="_blank">alcove</a> shelving and a handy heated mirror, it has been designed to perfection with quality fixtures and fittings. </strong></p><h2 class="body-h2">Who lives here</h2><p>Katerina and Mark, both software engineers, live in a Victorian terraced house in Highbury, north London.</p><h2 class="body-h2">Before</h2><p><strong>'</strong>The house has a single small bathroom that looked even smaller with a bathtub and a bulky basin,' says Katerina. 'The layout of the room was fine, but there was very little storage space.'</p><img alt="The large bathtub made the already small bathroom feel cramped." caption="The large bathtub made the already small bathroom feel cramped." credit="ADAM CARTER" height="1280" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/spacious-bathroom-wetroom-renovation-makeover-before-64dc89be755fd.jpeg" title="spacious-bathroom-wetroom-renovation-makeover-before.jpeg" width="960"><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>What kind of look did you want? </strong></h4><p class="body-text"><strong>Katerina: </strong>Our aim was to make the bathroom look more elegant and feel spacious. We decided to have a wet room and add luxe touches with brushed-brass finishes. Also, we were inspired by <a href="https://www.farrow-ball.com/paint-colours/setting-plaster" target="_blank">Farrow & Ball's Setting Plaster shade</a> and wanted to use it on the walls and ceiling to give an illusion of extra height. </p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>How did you get started? </strong></h4><p><strong>Katerina: </strong>As we had a fairly good idea of what we wanted, we created a Pinterest collection of images for reference and found specific photos for the <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/bathroom/g38915455/bathroom-tile-ideas/" target="_blank">tiles</a>, the wet room, the basin and cabinet. Then we went to Ripples with a drawn layout of the existing room and its dimensions to start the conversation and see what was feasible. </p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>Were there any particular challenges? </strong></h4><p class="body-text"><strong>Katerina: </strong>The main one was the size of the bathroom, which is only about 2x1.8m. We wanted to fit everything in and feel comfortable, not cramped. </p><img alt="Floating shelves create a streamlined, minimalist look" caption="Floating shelves create a streamlined, minimalist look" credit="ADAM CARTER" height="7536" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/spacious-bathroom-wetroom-renovation-makeover-64dc89d8517b8.jpeg" title="spacious-bathroom-wetroom-renovation-makeover.jpeg" width="5259"><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>You had certain priorities in mind... </strong></h4><p>We were keen to have underfloor heating, a heated mirror, an overhead and hand-held shower, more storage space and alcove shelving in the shower. </p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>Now it’s done, what do you like most? </strong></h4><p><strong>Katerina: </strong>Our finished <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/bathroom/g44649597/small-bathroom-ideas/" target="_blank">bathroom</a> is exactly what we wanted and has been designed to perfection.

        <![CDATA[<p class="body-text"><strong>A £50 bath and a basin snapped up on Facebook Marketplace have helped create an expensive-looking bathroom in what was previously a bedroom. </strong></p><h2 class="body-h2">Who lives here</h2><p>Vic White, a journalist (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/weboughtalondonhouse/?hl=en" target="_blank">@weboughtalondonhouse</a>), lives in a five-bedroom Victorian house in south-east London with her husband Peter and son Seb.</p><img alt="The space was originally a bedroom." caption="The space was originally a bedroom." credit="Vic White" height="1195" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/budget-bathroom-makeover-victorian-house4-64dc7f17321f7.jpeg" title="budget-bathroom-makeover-victorian-house4.jpeg" width="1798"><h2 class="body-h2">Before</h2><p>‘Originally this space was a bedroom, but as our new <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/renovate/build/a37983255/loft-conversion/" target="_blank">loft extension</a> provided us with two extra bedrooms, we were able to turn this one into a large family bathroom,' says Vic.<br></p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>What style were you going for? </strong></h4><p><strong>VW:</strong> I decided to go quite 'maximal' with lots of different textures and colours, which is not my usual style. My previous bathrooms have been quite modern and simple with grey or white fixtures. I'd seen a lot of people on Instagram doing more elaborate bathrooms and, as we had uncovered a gorgeous marble fireplace in the room, I decided to go for it this time. </p><img alt="Vibrantly coloured tiles and black fittings create a modern look" caption="Vibrantly coloured tiles and black fittings create a modern look" credit="Brent Darby / House Beautiful" height="5988" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/budget-bathroom-makeover-victorian-house1-64dc7f2f06aa4.jpeg" title="budget-bathroom-makeover-victorian-house1.jpeg" width="4480"><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>How did you plan the layout? </strong></h4><p><strong>VW: </strong>A freestanding bath was top of the list, so that was the first thing to think about. We used Frog Tape to outline its shape on the floor, then lay down within the space to see how it would feel in different areas of the room. The best place in the end was under the window, as you can lie in the bath and see the sky. </p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>Where did you get your fittings from? </strong></h4><p><strong>VW: </strong>All over! I bought the bath first on eBay for just £50 – I think the sellers just wanted rid of it. It's very heavy, so we enlisted some help from a friend with a van and strong arms. I then sold the taps that came with the bath on eBay for £50, so it ended up being technically free. We added a countertop basin to a chest of wooden drawers (bought via Facebook Marketplace) to serve as a vanity unit. I searched online for everything else. </p><img alt="The classic rolltop bath has been placed in the perfect position to enjoy gazing at the sky." caption="The classic rolltop bath has been placed in the perfect position to enjoy gazing at the sky." credit="Brent Darby / House Beautiful" height="6239" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/budget-bathroom-makeover-victorian-house3-64dc7f2d56dac.jpeg" title="budget-bathroom-makeover-victorian-house3.jpeg" width="4577"><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>You’ve been quite bold with colour... </strong></h4><p><strong>VW: </strong>Yes – I love the burnt orange Hoxton tiles from Mandarin Stone, so planned the rest of the scheme around them. We were worried about mixing the black modern fittings with the more traditional brass taps, but I like how eclectic it looks. The black window frame and shower screen pull it all together. I went for <a href="https://www.farrow-ball.com/paint-colours/setting-plaster" target="_blank">Setting Plaster by Farrow & Ball</a> on the walls as I think it goes with everything. </p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>What do you like most about the room now? </strong></h4><p><strong>VW: </strong>The feeling of space. Also it's so relaxing lying in the bath with the radio on, and I can use my church chair beside it to balance a book and a glass of wine. </p><img alt="The bath was bought on eBay for just £50." caption="The bath was bought on eBay for just £50." credit="Brent Darby / House Beautiful" height="4499" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/budget-bathroom-makeover-victorian-house2-64dc7f2b7f5a0.jpeg" title="budget-bathroom-makeover-victorian-house2.jpeg" width="6540"><h2 class="body-h2">Sourcebook </h2><ul><li>Bath, bath taps and sink, <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/" target="_blank">ebay.co.uk</a></li><li>Shower, <a href="https://www.drench.co.uk/" target="_blank">drench.co.uk</a></li><li>Shower screen, <a href="https://www.bathroommountain.co.uk/" target="_blank">bathroommountain.co.uk</a></li><li>WC, <a href="https://www.heatandplumb.com/" target="_blank">heatandplumb.com</a></li><li>Drawers, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/" target="_blank">Facebook Marketplace</a></li><li>Wall and floor tiles, <a href="https://www.mandarinstone.com/" target="_blank">mandarinstone.com</a></li><li>Mirror, <a href="https://www.grahamandgreen.co.uk/" target="_blank">grahamandgreen.co.uk</a></li><li>Wall lights, <a href="https://www.pooky.com/" target="_blank">pooky.com</a>. </li><li>Light switch, <a href="https://www.dowsingandreynolds.com/" target="_blank">dowsingandreynolds.com</a></li><li>Walls in Setting Plaster matt emulsion, <a href="https://farrow-ball.com/" target="_blank">farrow-ball.com</a>.</li><li>Basket with plant, <a href="https://www.homesense.com/home" target="_blank">homesense.com</a>.</li></ul><h2 class="body-h2">What it cost</h2><ul><li>Bath <strong>£50</strong></li><li>Bath taps<strong> £50</strong></li><li>Basin <strong>£120</strong></li><li>Basin taps <strong>£110</strong></li><li>Shower <strong>£100</strong></li><li>Shower screen <strong>£159 </strong></li><li>WC <strong>£200</strong></li><li>Drawers <strong>£50 </strong></li><li>Tiles <strong>£550 </strong></li><li>Mirror<strong> £179</strong></li><li>Lights & switch<strong> £200 </strong></li><li>Paint <strong>£105 </strong></li><li><strong>Total</strong> <strong>£1,823</strong></li></ul><p><strong><em>Follow House Beautiful on </em></strong><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@housebeautifuluk" target="_blank"><strong><em>TikTok</em></strong></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/housebeautifuluk/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Instagram</em></strong></a><strong><em>. </em></strong></p>]]>

Whether you're looking for <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/bathroom/a37964624/budget-small-bathroom-ideas/" target="_blank">budget small bathroom ideas</a> to maximise your space or want to create a spa-like <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/bathroom/a43144474/luxury-bathroom-ideas/" target="_blank">luxury bathroom</a>, we've picked the brains of some of the UK's top bathroom design experts and gathered our favourite small bathroom ideas for inspiration.</p><h2 class="body-h2">How to make a small bathroom look bigger</h2><p class="body-text">Bathroom expert Richard recommends looking for space-saving <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/bathroom/g43245303/bathroom-cabinets/" target="_blank">bathroom cabinets</a> and fittings when renovating a small bathroom: 'Wall-hung basins, vanity units and toilets work well as they free up additional floor space, giving the illusion of a bigger room. </p><p class="body-text">'Another quick way of creating the illusion of a bigger bathroom is to invest in <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/bathroom/g41423790/best-bathroom-mirrors/" target="_blank">bathroom mirrors</a>,' he adds. 'Natural light creates the illusion of greater size and space, so the more of it you have, the better.'</p><p><a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/lifestyle/storage/a29144268/small-bathroom-storage/" target="_blank">Small bathroom storage</a> is your friend, as clutter instantly makes a space feel more cramped. Look for vertical storage solutions, like shelving, where floor space is tight, and make the most of your shower or bath with nook storage, caddies and shower-hung shelving where possible.</p><p>Barrie Cutchie, design director at <a href="https://bcdesigns.co.uk/" target="_blank">BC Designs</a>, also has the following advice to make a small bathroom look bigger: 'When space is tight, the key is to distract the eye. This can be done by choosing a statement piece, such as a bath, in a colour other than white, as colour draws the eye in and helps to create a striking focal point.'</p><h2 class="body-h2">What is the best flooring for a small bathroom?</h2><p>Nothing is off limits when it comes to flooring options for a small bathroom. As it's a smaller surface area to cover, consider splashing out on a high quality stone or tile that will elevate the space. Even bold colours or patterned tiles can work when paired with plainer walls. </p><p>Large format tiles are a particularly clever choice for small <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/bathroom/a35215925/bathroom-flooring-ideas/" target="_blank">bathroom flooring</a>, as the lack of grout lines means there are fewer visual breaks which gives the illusion of a bigger space.</p><h2 class="body-h2">15 small bathroom ideas</h2><p class="body-text">Discover our top pick of small bathroom ideas, encompassing everything from smart storage and clever design solutions to bold colours and pretty patterns.</p>]]>

Positioning lighting near a mirror will also help bounce light around and make your bathroom seem more spacious.</p><p>Pictured: <a href="https://www.bertandmay.com/products/green-alalpardo-porcelain-tile" target="_blank">Alalpardo porcelain tiles at Bert & May</a></p><cite>Chris Snooks / House Beautiful</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/small-bathroom-ideas-walk-in-shower-orange-tiles-vic-white-photographer-brent-darby-64c257bcb26c9.jpeg" /><figcaption><h3>4) Tile a walk-in shower</h3><p>Walk-in showers can minimise visual disruption and make a small bathroom feel larger and lighter, as seen here, with consistent flooring and a glass screen.</p><cite>Brent Darby / House Beautiful</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/small-bathroom-ideas-white-green-round-mirror-phtoographer-rachel-whiting-styling-hannah-deacon-64c152b5b1dc7.jpeg" /><figcaption><h3>5) Use cohesive colours</h3><p>Stick to a limited palette to avoid overwhelming a small bathroom. This scheme uses bright white and botanical green for a fresh feel.</p><cite>House Beautiful/Rachel Whiting</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/small-bathroom-shower-64c21df391384.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>6) Match floors and walls</h3><p>Wrapping the same material around a wall and floor removes harsh angles and tricks the eye into making a space feel bigger. A large format tile has fewer visual interruptions to maximise this effect.</p><p>Pictured: <a href="https://www.porcelainsuperstore.co.uk/products/signature-rouge" target="_blank">Rouge tile at Porcelain Superstore</a></p><cite>Porcelain Superstore</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/small-bathroom-ideas-white-curtains-photographer-mark-scott-64c1525534db4.jpeg" /><figcaption><h3>7) Let the light in</h3><p>Sheer <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/windows/g44598388/window-dressing-ideas/" target="_blank">window treatments</a> are the best way to keep light pouring into a small bathroom while maintaining privacy.</p><cite>House Beautiful/Mark Scott</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/small-bathroom-ideas-floral-tiles-sink-64c21caa59076.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>8) Be brave with pattern</h3><p>There's no need to shy away from pattern in petite spaces. If anything, small bathrooms are the ideal space to experiment with bolder designs: less wall space equals less of a financial investment, and the look will be less overwhelming than on a huge wall – just avoid very large-scale motifs.</p><p>Pictured: <a href="https://www.originalstyle.com/im-0029456_english_garden_floral_single_tile.html" target="_blank">English garden floral tiles at Original Style</a></p><cite>Original Style</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/small-bathroom-ideas-colour-pink-bathmat-64c271a820fed.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>9) Consider accessories</h3><p>Colourful accessories like towels and bathmats will add instant character to a small bathroom, especially if you've opted for a pale neutral scheme that can risk feeling bland or sterile.</p><p>Pictured: <a href="https://www.oliverbonas.com/homeware/check-blue-yellow-bath-mat-large-350567" target="_blank">Check bathmat at Oliver Bonas</a></p><cite>Oliver Bonas</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/small-bathroom-ideas-storage-britton-unit-64c28bd691f54.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>10) Pick smart units</h3><p>To maximise a small bathroom and keep it clutter-free, combine concealed storage for unsightly cleaning products or pipework with open storage, where you can group more beautiful products, candles and jars.</p><p>Pictured: <a href="https://www.brittonbathrooms.com/product/hackney-700-furniture-unit-and-basin" target="_blank">Hackney furniture unit and basin at Britton Bathrooms</a></p><cite>Britton Bathrooms</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/small-bathroom-ideas-bath-tub-green-64c1534c477d7.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>11) Make a statement</h3><p>This gorgeous freestanding tub was especially created by BC Designs with small bathrooms in mind. It has a compact 1.36m footprint and can be custom-painted – we'd recommend a bold shade to create a focal point, which distracts the eye to make a small space feel larger.</p><p>Pictured: <a href="https://bcdesigns.co.uk/baths/penny-bath/" target="_blank">Penny bath by BC Designs</a></p><cite>BC Designs</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/small-bathroom-porcelain-superstore-fluted-pink-plain-tiles-64c25aae0aea0.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>12) Lay tiles vertically</h3><p>Laying metro tiles vertically instead of horizontally can make a space feel taller – great if you have limited head height or a sloping ceiling.</p><p>Pictured: <a href="https://www.porcelainsuperstore.co.uk/products/fluted-pink-plain" target="_blank">Fluted pink tiles at Porcelain Superstore</a></p><cite>Porcelain Superstore</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/small-bathroom-ideas-colourful-tiles-pink-sink-64c27242b685c.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>13) Go bold</h3><p>It's a common misconception that small spaces should be kept pale and neutral: a bold geometric pattern, like this pastel tile motif, can distract the eye and add depth to a scheme.</p><p>Pictured: <a href="https://www.crosswater.co.uk/product/beck-cloakroom-basin-inc-waste-1th-40x30?variant=27164" target="_blank">Beck cloakroom basin at Crosswater</a></p><cite>Crosswater</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/small-bathroom-james-edmondson-house-photographer-brent-darby-64c39fa877da5.jpeg" /><figcaption><h3>14) Think outside the box</h3><p>While there is a time and a place for clean lines and symmetry, embracing more irregular shapes in your small bathroom can help to zone the space without cutting it off visually. </p><cite>Brent Darby</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/small-bathroom-ideas-traditional-dark-grey-panelled-cloakroom-burlington-64c27e0a068bc.jpeg" /><figcaption><h3>15) Join the dark side</h3><p>There's no need to shy away from dark colours in a small bathroom: they can actually make a room seem bigger and more open by making the walls recede.</p><p>Dark grey works well in both contemporary and more traditional schemes, like this panelled cloakroom. </p><p>Pictured: <a href="https://www.burlingtonbathrooms.com/product/riviera-450mm-cloakroom-basin" target="_blank">Riviera cloakroom basin at Burlington Bathrooms</a></p><cite>Burlington Bathrooms</cite></figcaption></figure>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p class="body-text"><strong>Home renovation and design platform <a href="https://www.houzz.co.uk/" target="_blank">Houzz</a> has just released its 2023 bathroom trends report, putting the spotlight on how we're designing and styling the most private room in the house. </strong></p><p>The report gathers findings from more than 400 homeowners who are in the midst of, are planning, or recently completed a bathroom project. From energy efficient but luxurious <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/bathroom/g27912693/bathroom-ideas/" target="_blank">bathrooms</a>, to shower upgrades and plant-inspired havens, bathroom renovations that balance aesthetic desires with functional necessities remain key this year. Read on to find out more...</p><h2 class="body-h2">Spacious showers</h2><p class="body-text">A whopping 68 per cent of us have increased the size of our showers (32 per cent have at least doubled them in size). Out of the one in five who removed bathtubs, 82 per cent did so to gain a roomier shower, and while preference for a daily shower over a bath is not a big surprise, it's exciting to see that we want to elevate our daily shower ritual.</p><img alt="Bigger showers and waterfall showerhead features are both on the rise" caption="Bigger showers and waterfall showerhead features are both on the rise" credit="Chris Snook / Amy Stoddart Studio Ltd" height="2000" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/amy-stoddart-studio-ltd-chris-snook-photography-651155a3dd732.jpeg" title="Amy Stoddart Studio Ltd _ Chris Snook Photography .jpeg" width="3000"><h2 class="body-h2">Waterfall for the win</h2><p class="body-text">While we're on the topic, another trend is the move towards waterfall showers  – 78 per cent of us treated ourselves to one. We are choosing to invest in our self-care, hence the notion of the sanctuary-inspired <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/bathroom/g41901741/spathroom-ideas/" target="_blank">spathroom</a>. The cost of a new showerhead is a small price to pay for the daily therapeutic benefit of water pummelling on your shoulders. Add a few drops of essential oil or hang some dried eucalyptus for the full spa experience.<br></p><h2 class="body-h2">Bathtime for two</h2><p class="body-text">However, that's not to say that baths are a thing of the past. Plenty of us still love our daily soak – in fact, one in three have opted for a stylish freestanding tub and a significant 43 per cent have upgraded to a bath big enough to fit two people. The probable reason? Wanting more room for a fully immersive soak or to make space for a loved one.</p><img alt="Neutral bathroom with bathtub" caption="Neutral bathroom with bathtub" credit="Woodrow Vizor Architects / Adam Scott Photography" height="1821" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/neutral-bathroom-woodrow-vizor-architects-adam-scott-photography-65154fe64aaf4.jpeg" title="Neutral Bathroom - Woodrow Vizor Architects - Adam Scott Photography .jpeg" width="2200"><h2 class="body-h2">Technology is our friend</h2><p>Consistently the results show us that in the <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/bathroom/g42801920/bathroom-accessories/" target="_blank">bathroom</a> we're making the most of technological advances. We want our appliances to function with ease. We're upgrading to digital shower control features and nearly one in three of us bought a new toilet with high-tech functionality and automatic features. <br></p><h2 class="body-h2">Houseplants are a must</h2><p>This one is not particularly surprising because we've become a country of obsessive <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/garden/plants/g38733507/popular-houseplants/" target="_blank">houseplant</a> owners in the last decade. For most of us, houseplants are now key to our bathroom styling. We love them for their mood-boosting properties and air-purifying benefits, not forgetting that they look great too. Choose carefully though, the steamy environment of bathrooms won't suit every plant.</p><img alt="Houseplants are a key trend in bathrooms at the moment" caption="Houseplants are a key trend in bathrooms at the moment" credit="New Space Architecture" height="1826" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/new-space-architecture-651156ea4ce29.jpeg" title="New Space Architecture bathroom image.jpeg" width="2738"><h2 class="body-h2">We're wary of colour</h2><p>While generally we seem to be embracing more colour in our homes, in the bathroom we're still playing it safe. White continues to be the top choice, followed by <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/looks/tips/g249/grey-colour-schemes-stylist-tips/" target="_blank">grey</a> and then beige. It seems we want these spaces to remain neutral, calm and quiet. It's not surprising really for the rooms in which we unwind at the end of the day. </p><div class="embed-editoriallinks"></div><h2 class="body-h2">Modern and minimalist </h2><p>Almost 70 per cent are choosing to design bathrooms in a contemporary or modern style, with less than one in 10 decorating traditionally. What's more, we want our bathrooms to look uncluttered and function with ease. A rise in features like low-curb showers, wall-mounted toilets and basins, soft-close drawers and doors, and inbuilt organisers are signs that we want our bathrooms to be well organised, super streamlined and function smoothly. It's the Marie Kondo era in full swing.</p><img alt="modern bathroom design terrazzo" caption="modern bathroom design terrazzo" credit="KV Innovations" height="5647" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/design-pinterior-spaces-installation-kv-innovations-2-65129d9ec5b9e.jpeg" title="Design- Pinterior Spaces _ Installation- KV Innovations  2.jpeg" width="3765"><h2 class="body-h2">The environment comes first</h2><p>There is evidence we are making decisions with the environment in mind. Opting for energy efficient systems like radiant heating, choosing showers over baths, and prioritising efficiency in our appliances, are all indicators that we're putting <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/lifestyle/eco/g44996326/kevin-mccloud-green-heroes-grand-designs-live/" target="_blank">sustainability</a> at the centre.</p><p><strong><em>Follow House Beautiful on </em></strong><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@housebeautifuluk" target="_blank"><strong><em>TikTok</em></strong></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/housebeautifuluk/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Instagram</em></strong></a><strong><em>. </em></strong></p><hr><p><strong><em><br></em></strong></p>]]>

From small bathrooms to wet rooms, washbasins, bathtubs, <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/house-beautiful-collections/a39022716/homebase-tiles/" target="_blank">tiles</a>, cabinets and accessories, these bathroom ideas might just give you the inspiration to transform your own space.  </p><cite>Lizzie Orme</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/housebeautiful.cdnds.net/18/06/1518194213-shot-17-suffolk-modern-cottage.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>Bathroom ideas: marble</h3><p>This stunning marble bathtub adds a touch of luxury to this modern cottage in Suffolk.

Playful tiles are a great way to do this.</p><p>Pictured: <a href="https://www.homebase.co.uk/house-beautiful-cube-blush-porcelain-wall-floor-tile-200-x-200mm-0.52sqm-pack/13220593.html" target="_blank">House Beautiful Cube Blush Porcelain Tile at Homebase </a></p><cite>Homebase</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/broadstairs-kent-forever-home6-1532309557.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>Bathroom ideas: feature wall</h3><p>Geometric oak and blue glazed tiles from Mandarin Stone create a striking and unusual feature wall in this walk-in shower area.

We also love the small ladder which has been used as a towel rail.  </p><p><a class="body-btn-link" href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/renovate/homes-makeovers/a3167/rent-to-buy-north-yorkshire-home-diy-decorating/" target="_blank">TAKE A TOUR</a></p><cite>Katie Lee</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bathroom-ideas-wallpaper-1664369283.jpeg" /><figcaption><h3>Bathroom ideas: vintage inspiration</h3><p>Never be put off by the idea of wallpaper bubbling in a steamy bathroom – it is more resilient than you may think. Just be sure to use water-resistant materials in those areas likely to be splashed. We love this all-over vintage theme that informs colour and hardware choice here.</p><p>Pictured: <a href="https://www.littlegreene.com/richmond-green-bathroom" target="_blank">Richmond Green Wallpaper, and panelling painted in Baked Cherry, both at Little Greene</a></p><cite>Little Greene</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bathroom-tile-ideas-1643308404.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>Bathroom ideas: kit kat tiles</h3><p>If you are more inclined to decorate with a plain white tile, but don't want anything too stark or clinical, there are certain design features you can look out for – here, the addition of copper offers a warming element. </p><p>Pictured: <a href="https://www.homebase.co.uk/house-beautiful-aurelia-kingfisher-ceramic-wall-tile-75-x-300mm-0.5sqm-pack/13220568.html" target="_blank">House Beautiful Aurelia Cotton Ceramic Wall Tile at Homebase</a></p><cite>Homebase</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/housebeautiful.cdnds.net/17/40/pared-back-bathroom2.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>Bathroom ideas: graphic accents</h3><p>Zig-zag patterns and sleek grey walls give this contemporary bathroom a touch of grown-up glamour. <br></p><p><a class="body-btn-link" href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/renovate/homes-makeovers/a2554/small-bathroom-makeover-wimbledon/" target="_blank">TAKE A TOUR</a></p><cite>Fiona Walker-Arnott</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bathroom-tile-ideas-1643309767.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>Bathroom ideas: marble effect</h3><p>This fabulous bathroom updates organic marble-effect tiles with geometric Art Deco style wallpaper.

We love the use of a soft pink here that offers the perfect complement to lush green. <br></p><p>Pictured: <a href="https://www.carpetright.co.uk/vinyl/roma-581-navarra-vinyl/" target="_blank">Roma Navarra Vinyl at Carpetright</a></p><cite>Carpetright</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/loft-conversion-villa2-1560178510.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>Bathroom ideas: compact </h3><p>This converted loft bedroom features an ensuite wet room hidden behind a bookcase door.

The only problem with one as beautiful as this is that you'll never want to get out. </p><p><a class="body-btn-link" href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/renovate/homes-makeovers/a19478603/renovated-bathroom-makeover-bury-st-edmonds/" target="_blank">TAKE A TOUR</a></p><cite>Lizzie Orme</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/country-bathroom-ideas-double-sink-1642514760.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>Bathroom ideas: double sink</h3><p>The ultimate bathroom luxury for a two-person household.

We love this bold use of blue and white stripes that blends seamlessly from floor to wall – a great choice for a cloakroom or small bathroom.</p><p>Pictured: <a href="https://www.bertandmay.com/products/navy-alalpardo-porcelain-tile-per-sqm" target="_blank">Blue Alalpardo Porcelain Tile at Bert and May</a></p><cite>Bert & May</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/housebeautiful.cdnds.net/16/52/cottage-kent-8.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>Bathroom ideas: natural materials</h3><p>Marble wall tiles and a quirky stone vessel sink gives this bathroom a unique character. </p><p><a class="body-btn-link" href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/renovate/homes-makeovers/a1136/weatherboard-cottage-renovation-family-home/" target="_blank">TAKE A TOUR</a></p><cite>David Merewether</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bathroom-ideas-tiles-1664372288.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>Bathroom ideas: feature flooring</h3><p>Standout floor tiling can add a brilliant touch of character to an otherwise plain space – it's double effective in wet rooms where there is no shower tray, so you can tile the whole floor. </p><p>Pictured: <a href="https://capietra.com/shop/exterior/cabana-porcelain-new-orleans/" target="_blank">Cabana Porcelain New Orleans at Ca’Pietra</a></p><cite>CA'PIETRA</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/housebeautiful.cdnds.net/17/01/lo2901pw-018_preview.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>Bathroom ideas: hotel inspired</h3><p>This stunning bathroom space was inspired by a boutique hotel — and we can't get enough of the geometric floor tiles. <br></p><p><a class="body-btn-link" href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/renovate/homes-makeovers/a579/small-vintage-bathroom-makeover/" target="_blank">TAKE A TOUR</a></p><cite>Lizzie Orme</cite></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/housebeautiful.cdnds.net/16/13/1459335943-bold-beautiful-bathroom.jpg" /><figcaption><h3>Bathroom ideas: block colours</h3><p>Create a statement with a bold, blue splash of paint.
