         <description>A recent decision from the National Labor Relations Board adds to a wave of worker-friendly rulings from the agency.</description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A recent ruling by the National Labor Relations Board adds to a
series of recent decisions from the agency on behalf of workers,
with the decision in this case involving a group of prospective
employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Feb. 5 ruling, a regional director for the NLRB in Boston
said the men’s college basketball players at Dartmouth College are
employees within the definition of the National Labor Relations Act
and ruled that the 15 people on the team could vote on whether to
unionize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It opens the door to a lot of interesting questions,” said J.T.
Holt, a partner in law firm Reed Smith LLP’s labor and employment
group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holt stressed that the NLRB decision is far from making
unionization a certainty. The players will still have to vote on
unionization — a vote is scheduled for Tuesday, March 5 — and
Dartmouth can appeal the regional director’s decision to the full
board. If either group dislikes the outcome there, it can appeal
directly into the federal circuit court system and from there the
Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holt said the Dartmouth decision is in some ways a replay of the
NLRB’s 2015 decision rejecting a petition by football players at
Northwestern University to unionize, denying their claims they were
employees. In that case, the students were receiving scholarships.
At Dartmouth, the basketball players are not on scholarship, but
the students are receiving remuneration in the form of merchandise
and the value of their degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/news-and-insights/nlrb-dartmouth-decision.html&quot;&gt;A blog post
by law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP&lt;/a&gt; spelled out
both the complexities of what might be ahead and what’s at
stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An ultimate decision in this case is still subject to the
NLRB’s lengthy appeal process; nevertheless, absent congressional
action, it is likely that higher education institutions will
increasingly face external pressure to treat student-athletes as
employees in the coming years,” the authors of the blog post
wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by the NLRB regional director is the latest in a
series of decisions and efforts by the NLRB on behalf of workers in
recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The board has been active in the Biden administration and will
continue to be for so long as the Biden administration is in place
—&amp;nbsp;whether it’s this term or four [more] years if there is
another term,” Holt said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those efforts include the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-issues-final-rule-on-joint-employer-status&quot;&gt;joint-employer rule, released in October&lt;/a&gt;,
that dramatically expands how related companies have to approach
unions and collective bargaining. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2023/08/25/labor-union-organizing-election-nlrb-government.html&quot;&gt;The NLRB also removed some procedural steps for union
elections&lt;/a&gt;, substantially speeding up the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;NLRB earlier last year said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2023/03/28/nlrb-nda-nondisparagement-rights-union.html&quot;&gt;the use of non-disparagement and non-disclosure
agreements in severance agreements may violate federal labor
laws&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Also last year, the NLRB overruled a litmus test
established during the Trump administration in 2019 for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2023/06/15/nlrb-independent-contractor-rules-change.html&quot;&gt;how businesses classify independent contractors&lt;/a&gt;
in favor of a test established in 2014, which broadens the test and
would, in essence, categorize more workers as employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It certainly appears that there is a trend to push for an
expansive definition of employee,&quot; Holt said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies ultimately will have a harder time classifying workers
as independent contractors&amp;nbsp;under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20240109-1&quot;&gt;a new Department of
Labor final rule that kicks in on March 11&lt;/a&gt;. The agency said the
final rule&amp;nbsp;better aligns government regulations with
“longstanding judicial precedent” and better adheres to the Fair
Labor Standards Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tug-of-war over who is and who is not an employee is closely
tied to unionization efforts. Those who fall under the National
Labor Relations Act gain unionization protections; those who do
not, do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And despite high-profile union victories last year by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2023/08/23/teamster-ratify-labor-agreement-with-ups-inc.html&quot;&gt;workers at United Parcel Service Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/news/2023/11/08/end-of-actos-strike.html&quot;&gt;actors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2023/09/25/hollywood-writers-reach-tentative-agreement.html&quot;&gt;writers&lt;/a&gt; and others, the overall union member rate
within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/union2.pdf&quot;&gt;United States was at 10% in
2023, down slightly from 10.1% in 2022&lt;/a&gt; — although the overall
number of union members grew by about 139,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the number of striking workers more than doubled from
2022 to 2023, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/default/files-d8/2024-02/Labor-Action-Tracker-2023-Annual-Report.pdf&quot;&gt;according to
the Cornell-ILR Labor Action Tracker.&lt;/a&gt; That total counts 470
work stoppages involving about 539,000 workers last year, up from
433 work stoppages in 2022 involving 224,000 workers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>The Braves are renovating Truist Park to improve the fan experience.</description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta Braves are pitching some new hospitality experiences
at Truist Park this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Braves are enhancing amenities already popular with fans
while adding upgrades&amp;nbsp;to &quot;provide the unparalleled experience
that visitors have come to expect at Truist Park,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2024/02/28/battery-truist-park-mike-plant.html&quot;&gt;president and CEO Derek Schiller&lt;/a&gt; said in a
prepared statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renovations are part of a multiphase plan for improvements
at Truist Park, according to the team. The first phase represents
an investment of approximately $10 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New for the 2024 season will be a Blue Moon Beer Garden inside
the Roof, according to a news release. The beer garden intends to
serve multiple Molson Coors brands and a variety of food
options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans call for a renovated and expanded group hospitality space
that overlooks the field adjacent to the beer garden. It will be
able to accommodate groups as large as 210, per the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In left field, the Braves plan to debut a new group space called
the Jim Beam Bourbon Decks behind Sections 142 and 143. This will
include private access to a new bar, which will also serve
customers on the concourse, according to the release. It will
include two bars with a combined length of 60’ 6” — mirroring the
distance between the pitcher’s mound and home plate — as well as a
unique lighting fixture and game-used pitching rubber and home
plate inset into the bar top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Braves plan to move Slice Pizza to Section 113. Bars on the
first-and third-base sides of the terrace level will be upgraded,
and all suites will be refurbished over the next four years, per
the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond renovating Truist Park's food and drink options, the
Braves Clubhouse Store is set for a 1,500-square-foot expansion and
redesign to &quot;provide a premium retail experience.&quot; New to the store
will be a dedicated jersey walk-up shop that houses the majority of
the jersey selection in the store, as well as a new game-used
merchandise section, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes to the store's layout and a new point-of-sale system are
meant to speed up the shopping experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schiller said the upgrades &quot;offer additional opportunities to
create lasting memories at every game, concert and event inside
Truist Park.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detroit-based sports architecture firm Rossetti is working with
the Braves on the renovations. Atlanta-based Impact Development
Management is an adviser on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2022/07/05/braves-revenue-world-series-mlb.html&quot;&gt;Truist Park has been a cash cow for the Braves&lt;/a&gt;
since the team moved to the stadium in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the Braves generated $581.6 million in baseball
revenue, which includes ticket sales, concessions, advertising
sponsorships, suites and premium seat fees, as well as national and
local broadcast rights, according to the team's earnings report.
Baseball revenue increased 9% compared with 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>Cam Kirk, an expert photographer and philanthropist, spoke to the Chronicle about his latest projects.</description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cameron &quot;Cam Kirk&quot; Kirkland, is widely known in his industry as
an expert photographer and a philanthropist. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morehouse College graduate, from Maryland, has been rooted
in Atlanta for nearly two decades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He founded Cam Kirk Studios in 2017, a 7,000-square-foot
photography safe space, which now books hundreds of appointments a
month for established and up-and-coming artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He recently launched Collective Gallery, which he describes as a
“label-like company for photographers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After I was running the studio for about three or four years, I
met so many talented individuals that just needed one little piece
of guidance,&quot; Kirkland said. &quot;They needed one person to really
believe in them, or one financial investment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what sparked the Collective. Kirkland signed seven
artists in his first year and invested $20,000 in each of their
projects, along with the guidance of the Cam Kirk team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of our artists have gone on to work with Netflix, Adidas,
Nike, Squarespace,&quot; he said. &quot;Our main thing was getting them to
diversify their streams of income as creatives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirkland himself has worked with countless brands and musical
talents from Migos to Gucci Mane. He credits Morehouse for
anchoring him to the Atlanta community and says attending the
school is “one of the best decisions” he ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirkland’s team regularly takes on interns from Atlanta’s
historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and currently
has students from Morehouse, Spelman College and Clark Atlanta
University. There’s now a program at Morehouse for content
creation. Students tell Kirk they came to the school because of
him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, he told the Chronicle, he visited the program for a
day and donated $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s also behind the Downtown Atlanta clean-up effort “Spin the
Block.” It started as an initiative to clear trash around the
community in 2019 and now happens about every quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirkland adopted Forsyth and Brotherton streets, he said, after
City of Atlanta officials told him that they were unable to provide
recycling in that area. He also gifted $25,000 toward the
project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next event will likely be around Earth Day in April,
Kirkland said.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>It was the highest residential price in Atlanta since 2020.</description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Buckhead estate in metro Atlanta's wealthiest ZIP code just
fetched the highest home price in years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas E. and Kimbrough P. Noonan sold the Riverly Road estate
next to the Chattahoochee River for about $12.9 million,
Atlanta-based Dorsey Alston Realtors announced. Dorsey Alston's
Shanna Smith was the listing agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale closed March 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price was the highest for a residential property in the city
of Atlanta since May 2020, when comedian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2020/06/02/steve-harvey-wife-bought-ex-tyler-perry-estate.html&quot;&gt;Steve Harvey and his wife bought a Buckhead estate
from film mogul Tyler Perry&lt;/a&gt; for $15 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Noonan is the former president and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2006/08/21/daily18.html#:~:text=Sign%20in-,A%20business%20started%20at%20Georgia%20Tech%20will%20soon%20become%20part,Tech%20engineering%20student%20Christopher%20Klaus&quot;&gt;Internet Security Systems Inc., which International
Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) bought&lt;/a&gt; for $1.3 billion in
2006. He was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2015/08/27/atlantas-most-admired-ceo-awards-2015-slideshow.html&quot;&gt;Atlanta Business Chronicle's Most Admired CEOs&lt;/a&gt;
honoree in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Shanna understood the uniqueness of the house and the property,
and she was meticulous in every aspect of the marketing and sale of
our home,&quot; said Kim Noonan in a prepared statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Claugus, founder of Atlanta-based GMT Capital Corp., was the
buyer, a person with knowledge of the transaction told Atlanta
Business Chronicle. Bonneau Ansley III of Ansley Real Estate
Christie's International represented Claugus, according to First
Multiple Listing Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2023/08/28/buckhead-mansion-for-sale-chattahoochee-river.html&quot;&gt;Dorsey Alston listed the estate in August&lt;/a&gt;. It had
been on the market for more than a year prior to the firm's
listing, Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is an exceptional property, and our goal was to attract
discerning buyers,&quot; she said in a prepared statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estate includes a roughly 14,000-square-foot main house,
carriage house, horse barn with three stalls, paddock and riding
trails, Har-Tru clay tennis court, Par 3 golf hole, and six-car
garage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house was built in 2000, per the listing. Atlanta-based
architecture firm William T. Baker and Associates designed the
house. Atlanta-based Suzanne Kasler Interiors was the interior
designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architect took inspiration from a modern day English Country
estate for the design, according to Dorsey Alston listing. The
exterior of the house includes hand-carved Indiana limestone, old
Carolina wood-moulded brick and a Vermont slate roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside, the foyer leads to a stairwell with detailed ironwork
and hand-carved moldings, meant to be reminiscent of the Swan House
at Atlanta History Center. The main level includes a renovated
kitchen, designed by Jane Hollman with Studio Entourage, with white
marble countertops and Wolf and SubZero appliances. The keeping
room has fireside seating, and the breakfast room opens to a large
living room with floor-to-ceiling windows. The formal dining room
features hand-painted de Gournay wall coverings. The primary
bedroom suite has two bathrooms, each with large closets, and a
fireside sitting room that opens to a poolside terrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upper level includes five bedroom suites, an additional
laundry room, den and great room. The lower terrace level has a
media room with a projection screen, home office, billiard room,
game room, gym, sauna and steam room, and a wine cellar and tasting
room. There is a craft and wrapping room, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carriage house has a full kitchen, living room, bedroom and
full bathroom, along with a loggia with a grilling patio and pizza
oven overlooking the tennis court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional amenities include a heated saltwater pool and spa,
automated entry gate, and whole-house generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estate is within Atlanta's 30327 ZIP code, the metro area's
most affluent. There were 364 home sales with a median price of
about $1.3 million in 30327 during the 12 months ending Feb. 29.
The median price was 5.9% higher than the previous 12-month
period.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>The company's CEO went from developing plastics to people.</description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When the Covid-19 pandemic ramped up in 2020, the leadership
development firm Pathbuilders was forced to move its long-standing
education and mentoring programs online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We used to do everything live, in ballrooms,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2020/11/17/q-a-helene-lollis-atlanta-2020-most-admired-ceo.html&quot;&gt;Helene Lollis&lt;/a&gt;, president and CEO of Pathbuilders,
admitting that for her, the shift was akin to “killing a sacred
cow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the pandemic just might have helped the Atlanta-based firm
do for itself what it has aimed to do for aspiring women leaders
since 1995 — build new pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of its redesigned mentoring model and technology
upgrades “radically changed our reach,” Lollis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re 40% bigger today than we were before the pandemic,” she
said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lollis, an engineer by trade, participated in a mentoring
program organized by the company before it was known as
Pathbuilders. The experience not only changed her career
trajectory, it later led her to purchase in 2002 the consulting
company that would later become Pathbuilders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During an interview for the podcast, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/feature/on-leadership/2021&quot;&gt;On Leadership with Atlanta Business Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;,”
Lollis said she is focused on introducing “what we do to a national
market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had always been Atlanta-centric, but now a typical cohort
for us has 25 companies represented, and 30 states represented,”
Lollis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical cohort is made up of about 80 women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the company reached a new milestone. Since its
founding, Pathbuilders graduated more than 3,000 women from its
flagship mentoring program called Achieva.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>It's no shock that the Ivy League fared well among the nation's wealthiest colleges and universities — but which other schools topped the list? Find out and see where your alma mater ranks.</description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Endowments at the 100 wealthiest colleges in America fell by an
average of 3.3% between 2021 and 2022, but they rose an average of
35% since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s according to a recent &lt;em&gt;Business Journals&lt;/em&gt; analysis
of data from the U.S. Department of Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationally, endowments at all U.S. colleges and universities
with available data declined 4.5% between 2021 and 2022 but are up
32% since 2019. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2022/02/24/university-endowments-2021-returns.html&quot;&gt;The early pandemic stock market boom produced
exceptional results for some universities&lt;/a&gt;, it also widened the
gap between the very wealthiest schools and all others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While endowments support a variety of initiatives at many
schools and are designed to ensure universities can fulfill their
missions in the long term, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2022/02/24/university-endowments-2021-returns.html&quot;&gt;critics often question the purpose of the nation’s
largest, multibillion endowments.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While schools with the most generous endowments are
predominantly private, several large public universities also
appear on the list of wealthiest schools. However, due to larger
student bodies, their endowment assets per undergrad ratios were
considerably lower than that of the smaller, private schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With $6,268,062 in endowment assets per undergrad, Princeton
University ranked as the wealthiest university in the U.S. on our
List.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the searchable database below, you can compare endowment
totals for all American universities with available data from
fiscal year 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While endowment spending has exploded over the last five to 10
years, recent returns were generally flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the lackluster performance, some education experts still
warn of transparency issues, especially as investments shift from
public securities to private equity and venture capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Elite, private university endowment investments remain opaque
and secretive,” said Charlie Eaton, an economic sociologist at
University of California at Merced, and author of “Bankers in the
Ivory Tower: The Troubling Rise of Financiers in U.S. Higher
Education.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even though endowments are commonly used to support
scholarships, research and other academic initiatives, some schools
are increasingly directing gifts to endowments then using
tax-exempt municipal bonds to finance named buildings and
facilities associated with donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These practices “exploit tax subsidies for donations that rarely
go to expanding schools’ socio-economic diversity and undergraduate
enrollments,” Eaton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endowments grow at HBCUs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One trend that was evident in the research was the recent growth
of endowments at Historically Black Colleges and Universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endowments at HBCUs grew by more than $1 billion — from $3.9
billion to $5.2 billion — between 2020 and 2021, thanks in large
part to a $560 million gift from Mackenzie Scott. But that wasn't
the only factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last September, Atlanta’s Morehouse College issued a “call to
action,” raising $1.5 million in 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/birmingham/news/2024/01/23/lilly-endowment-100-million-uncf.html&quot;&gt;Lilly Endowment recently granted the
United Negro College Fund $100 million&lt;/a&gt; to support the
organization’s $1 billion capital fund. The gift was announced Jan.
11, during a media conference at Clark Atlanta University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven days later, Spelman College trustee Ronda Stryker, a
director of Stryker Corp., a medical equipment company founded by
her grandfather, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2024/01/18/spelman-college-historic-donation-stryker.html&quot;&gt;pledged to give the HBCU $100 million.&lt;/a&gt;
The bequest is the largest single gift to Spelman, for which 2022
endowment totaled $497.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, UC Merced’s Eaton remains concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Smaller private schools and HBCUs rarely receive comparable
returns from private equity and hedge funds because they do not
have access to the highest performing funds and cannot negotiate
for the most favorable fee structure,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>Amazon is buying up more land in Georgia.</description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amazon is back at buying up land in Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past couple of months the company's subsidiary, Amazon
Data Services Inc., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2024/01/08/amazon-subsidiary-buys-430-acres-in-covington.html&quot;&gt;acquired 430 acres in Covington&lt;/a&gt;. Another
subsidiary recently bought about 22 acres just outside of
Macon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Services LLC, a subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc., paid
about $1.2 million in January for the land that is about 80 miles
south of Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The land is located in an area neighboring warehouse buildings
off of I-475, which branches off of I-75. The property is about 10
miles from Amazon's nearby Fulfillment Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Although the land in question is not owned by the Macon-Bibb
County Industrial Authority (MBCIA), we are always excited about
the potential of existing industry expansion within Macon-Bibb
County,&quot; a spokesperson for the Industrial Authority said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon's expansion in Georgia follows the company's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2020/03/27/decade-of-growth-amazon-confirms-new-1-000.html&quot;&gt;multiple investments&lt;/a&gt; in the state in 2020,
particularly in metro Atlanta. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2020/10/19/amazon-opens-georgia-facilities.html&quot;&gt;The company has sortation centers&lt;/a&gt; in Union City,
East Point and Jefferson. Its other fulfillment centers are located
in Braselton, Lithia Springs, Union City and Jefferson. Amazon
announced in 2020 it would have a new fulfillment center in
Gwinnett County, near the Dekalb County property line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon's broker declined to comment about this sale.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>An open-air bar will move into long-vacant and dilapidated building next to Northside Tavern.</description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Northside Tavern, the bluesy West Midtown dive that's been in
business for a half-century, is getting a new neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italian restaurant Yeppa &amp; Co. is developing its third Atlanta
location on the same property that houses Northside Tavern. The
restaurant will move into long-vacant and dilapidated building on
the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renovations to the building will include the construction of an
exterior pavilion canopy structure that covers approximately 2,300
square feet, a new bar and new Americans with Disabilities
Act-compliant restrooms, according to a building permit application
submitted to the City of Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tommy Webb, owner of Northside Tavern and the surrounding
property, told Atlanta Business Chronicle he is leasing out the
space for the new restaurant. Allen Morris &amp; Co., developer of the
massive Star Metals District mixed-use development that looms over
Northside Tavern, is working with Webb and Yeppa &amp; Co's owners on
the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pietro Gianni and Stephen Peterson, co-owners of Atlanta Italian
restaurants Storico Fresco, Forza Storico and Storico Vino, opened
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2022/01/14/atlanta-restaurants-buckhead-village-biltong-yeppa.html&quot;&gt;Yeppa &amp; Co.'s first location in Buckhead Village&lt;/a&gt;
in February 2023. Gianni and Peterson are developing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2023/07/21/beltline-restaurant-yeppa-co-italian-eastside.html&quot;&gt;a second Yeppa &amp; Co. near the Atlanta BeltLine's
Eastside Trail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restaurant's concept is centered on food, wine and cocktails
from Rimini in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Yeppa &amp; Co.
serves focaccia pizzas, panini and regional pastas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gianni and Peterson previously planned to open an outpost for
Pachengo's, their taqueria concept, next to Northside Tavern,
according to planning documents submitted to the city last
year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan Hedges, Allen Morris Co.'s managing director of
acquisitions and development in the Southeast, and representatives
for Yeppa &amp; Co. did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webb told the Chronicle Yeppa &amp; Co. will operate an open-air bar
with a food truck on the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2021/11/25/pandemic-northside-tavern-west-midtown.html&quot;&gt;Northside Tavern is an Atlanta icon&lt;/a&gt;. Webb’s
father, Butler, bought it in 1972 and eventually converted it from
a pool hall into a blues club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, it's small island serving as a reminder of West
Midtown's past in a sea of glittering residential and office
development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, he held talks with the owners of Nashville-based
Hattie B's Hot Chicken about a location for the restaurant next to
Northside Tavern. They couldn't reach a deal, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2019/08/09/hattie-b-largest-location-opening-west-midtown.html&quot;&gt;Hattie B's opened elsewhere in West Midtown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webb said Yeppa &amp; Co. is a good fit as a neighbor because it
will bring patrons to the property earlier in the day. The
restaurant will likely close earlier in the evening than Northside
Tavern's peak hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This place will be winding down as we're picking up,&quot; Webb
said.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>LGI Homes announced the opening of a community of single-family homes in this east Atlanta suburb.</description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Texas single-family housing developer is expanding for the
first time into rapidly growing Gwinnett County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LGI Homes has opened Bold Springs Farm in Dacula, a city in
northeastern Gwinnett about 50 miles from Downtown Atlanta. The
project offers homes in the $380,000 range, according to the
company. That is well below the median list price for homes in
Dacula, which measured $493,000 this past January and just over 23%
of homes sold were over asking price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affordable housing options have become increasingly
limited&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2024/02/14/gwinnett-county-affordable-housing-tiny-houses.html&quot;&gt;across Gwinnett County&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as Atlanta
natives and new residents alike &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2023/11/19/atlanta-affordabie-housing-transportation-uli.html&quot;&gt;migrate to the city’s suburbs&lt;/a&gt; in search of more
space and cheaper prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new development includes four detached single-family floor
plans spanning three to five bedrooms and ranging from
approximately 2,000 square feet to 2,600 square feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LGI Homes is tapping into Gwinnett's population growth. The
county surpassed 5 million residents in 2022, according to the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://33n.atlantaregional.com/21-county-data-dashboard&quot;&gt;Atlanta
Regional Commission&lt;/a&gt;. Dacula increased from about 4,400
residents in 2010 to roughly 6,800 in 2020, according to data from
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/daculacitygeorgia/HSD410222&quot;&gt;U.S.
Census&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value for the average home in Dacula stands at approximately
$447,000 according to Zillow’s Home Value Index, having increased
by 1.6% over the 12-month period lasting from January 2023 to
2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home values in neighboring Lawrenceville have also increased
year-over-year, but the median list price for houses in the city
falls just short of $400,000, according to Zillow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LGI Homes focuses on one-and two-story homes for families in the
outskirts of major metropolitan cities. It uses in-house
consultants to initiate closings and move in new residents within a
span of 45 days. The developer now operates within 35 markets
inside 20 U.S. states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LGI Homes owns additional metro Atlanta
properties in Conyers, Fairburn and Locust Grove. The company also
manages communities in greater Athens and LaGrange.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>The SoCal brand has become a staple in well-off millennial men’s wardrobes.</description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vuori, the Southern California activewear company that has
become a staple in well-off millennial men’s wardrobes, is taking
its first brick-and-mortar steps in Georgia with a shop in Buckhead
Village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The store will move into an existing site that is slightly over
2,800 square feet, and the construction cost will be around $1.2
million, according to a building permit submitted to the City of
Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owner&amp;nbsp;Joe Kudla founded Vuori in a surf town outside of San
Diego in 2015. Vuori, the Finnish word for &quot;mountain,&quot; designs
men’s and women’s tops, joggers, outerwear and more in premium
materials at a contemporary price point comparable to
Lululemon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first couple years of the company's existence, Kudla
focused on perfecting menswear, seeing a need in the market for
yoga and gym gear of better quality. In 2018, Kudla brought
womenswear into the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211013005305/en/Vuori-Receives-400-Million-Investment-and-4B-Valuation-from-SoftBank-Vision-Fund-2&quot;&gt;$400 million
investment at a $4 billion valuation&lt;/a&gt; from Softbank vision Fund
2 in 2021, Vuori set its expansion sights high. The company
declared it would open 100 retail locations by 2026&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of February 2024, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristenphilipkoski/2024/02/27/a-rising-athleisure-brand-sparkles-in-the-sectors-bright-future/?sh=1e0763935662&quot;&gt;Vuori had 50
stores in 17 states&lt;/a&gt; as well as in London, Shanghai and Seoul,
according to Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buckhead Village is home to several upscale shops and
restaurants. On the retail front there’s Dior, Hermès and Alice and
Olivia, to name a few. For dining, the selection includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2018/09/07/wine-and-dine-le-bilboquet-atlanta-beverage.html&quot;&gt;Le Bilboquet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2022/01/14/atlanta-restaurants-buckhead-village-biltong-yeppa.html&quot;&gt;Yeppa &amp; Co.&lt;/a&gt; and Carmel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vuori and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2019/07/26/how-jamestown-plans-to-bring-atlanta-back-to-the.html&quot;&gt;Jamestown Properties, the owner of Buckhead
Village&lt;/a&gt;, did not immediately respond to requests for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>The property, located in Atlanta's Sweet Auburn neighborhood, has struggled with crime.</description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A 592-unit apartment complex in Atlanta’s Sweet Auburn
neighborhood has traded hands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houston-based Hilltop Residential acquired the more than 9-acre
property for $115 million, according to property records. That is
just under $200,000 per unit. The deal closed Feb. 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apartment complex, now called “The Lookout at O4W,” is
located at 180 Jackson St., near the Martin Luther King, Jr.
National Historical Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bisnow.com/atlanta/news/multifamily/camden-selling-apartments-named-among-atlantas-most-dangerous-for-115m-122756&quot;&gt;Bisnow
Atlanta first reported the sale last month&lt;/a&gt; but did not identify
the buyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hilltop Residential declined an interview request. But in a
LinkedIn post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/craig-marbach-07787721_i-am-pleased-to-announce-that-hilltop-has-activity-7163530276315340800-ydib/&quot;&gt;Hilltop
executive Craig Marbach said&lt;/a&gt; the company plans to renovate the
amenities at the apartment complex, including its rooftop areas
that overlook Downtown and Midtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apartment complex, previously called Camden Vantage, has
struggled with violence, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajc.com/news/investigations/dwellings/list-dangerous-apartments/&quot;&gt;according to
an investigation from The Atlanta-Journal Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. From
2017 to June 2023, police reported 189 crimes at the address, the
newspaper reported as part of its “Dangerous Dwellings” series.
That includes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/girl-killed-jackson-street-apartment-shooting-atlanta&quot;&gt;fatal
shooting of a 7-year-old girl in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, according to news
reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous owner of the property, an affiliate of Camden
Property Trust, said in a February earnings call that the company
was ready to offload the apartment complex. The Camden affiliate
had paid $82.5 million for the apartment complex in 2013, according
to property records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We keep a list of and have ongoing
conversations with our operating groups about, if there were to be
a sale out of one of your markets or submarkets, which assets would
be in that conversation,” Camden President Keith Oden told analysts. “And
[Camden] Vantage almost always came up as
one that would be on the list of management's list of assets that
they would rather someone else take care of.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multifamily investment sales volume has slowed considerably in
Atlanta, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2024/01/22/animal-200-million-southeast-acquisitions.html&quot;&gt;dropping 68% from 2022 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;, according to data
CoStar provided to the Chronicle in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hilltop now has eight properties in Georgia, including four in
Atlanta. Marbach, in his LinkedIn post about The Lookout at O4W,
referenced its proximity to shopping and dining hotspots Krog
Street Market and Ponce City Market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We look forward to continuing to grow Hilltop's portfolio in
Atlanta and throughout the Southeast and Texas,&quot; he said in the
social media post.&lt;/p&gt;

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bankruptcies are on the rise as pandemic-related relief measures
come to an end and higher interest rates push business owners over
the edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankruptcy filings of all types peaked at around 1.6 million in
2010, during the height of the Great Recession, and plateaued at
around 774,000 annually in the years leading up to the Covid-19
pandemic. In the subsequent years, with a host of relief programs
for individuals, families and businesses taking effect, the number
of annual filings slid to about 388,000, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uscourts.gov/statistics-reports/analysis-reports/bankruptcy-filings-statistics/bankruptcy-statistics-data&quot;&gt;according to
data from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts on behalf of
the Federal Judiciary&lt;/a&gt;. That number increased to about 453,000
last year, and experts expect it will continue to rise in the
months and years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the height of the pandemic, many Americans received
relief payments from the federal government — either in the form of
stimulus checks or an expanded child tax credit. People with
student loans saw their payments and interest rates freeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Kurtzman, CEO at Stretto, a bankruptcy services and
technology firm, said while Americans benefited from those and
other relief measures, that same combination of forces led to a hot
economy that pushed the Federal Reserve to raise interest
rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had a great couple years as an economy,” Kurtzman said.
“What didn’t happen during that time was any kind of financial
lessons. It’s not like our country got a group class on how to be
financially solvent and mature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with interest rates higher, people and businesses that
didn’t lock in low rates on mortgages or other debt are seeing the
impact of rising rates, and many are finding themselves unable to
handle obligations that had been temporarily forestalled during the
pandemic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are still nowhere near a normal year of bankruptcy filings,&quot;
Kurtzman said. &quot;We’ve got quite a bit of growing to do before we
reach a normal year. We are going to see a larger than normal year
come before it starts to decelerate. It may take us two years to
get there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the pandemic, the lineup of federal support
programs made available to business owners included the Paycheck
Protection Program, the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program and
the Employee Retention Credit program. Those and other relief
programs likely kept many small businesses solvent that wouldn’t
have survived the pandemic years without the support, Kurtzman
said, but the programs also kept afloat a number of businesses that
would have shuttered even without the pandemic — creating a sort of
time-delayed bankruptcy backlog that's emerging now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2024/20240206&quot;&gt;Total
household debt rose by $212 billion in the fourth quarter of
2023&lt;/a&gt;, continuing an upward trajectory that began in about 2011,
according to data from the Federal Reserve.&amp;nbsp;Loan-delinquency
rates continue to rise, as well, with 3.1% of that debt in some
stage of delinquency, and credit card balances and auto loans
seeing the largest annual delinquency increases.&amp;nbsp;About 1.42%
of all debt was at least 90 days delinquent as of the end of 2023,
up from 1.03% at the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessika Arce Graham, a partner at Weiss Serota Helfman Cole &amp;
Bierman, said many corporate clients prefer out-of-court
restructurings over formal insolvencies.&amp;nbsp;However, since
interest rates are higher and cheaper financing is no longer
available, many business owners may have exhausted their funding
and will have no choice but to file for bankruptcy going
forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will continue to see a steady rise in bankruptcies across
all chapters in the coming years as both businesses and individuals
grapple with debt, inflation and high interest rates,” Graham said
in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larger companies already are seeing a substantial surge in
bankruptcy filings, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/us-bankruptcies-hit-13-year-peak-in-2023-50-new-filings-in-december-79967180&quot;&gt;according to
data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence,&lt;/a&gt; which tracked
bankruptcies for public companies and for private companies with
either public debt of more than $2 million or with assets or
liabilities above $10 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By that metric, bankruptcies hit 642 in 2023, the highest annual
mark since 2010 and far above the 372 recorded in 2022.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Stuart, CEO of Turnaround Management Association, said
it's not guaranteed that bankruptcies will return to pre-pandemic
levels, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2024/01/18/pay-raises-salary-wages-profit-economy-recession.html&quot;&gt;a potential recession appears to have been avoided in
favor of a &quot;soft landing&quot; for the economy, and indicators point to
a better road ahead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, companies that were in poor shape before the pandemic
or were surviving on low-interest loans and government assistance
won’t be able to do so in the years to come, Stuart said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we continue to be in a period of unsettledness where cost of
money remains high and business stresses can no longer be masked by
stimulus money or low-cost, covenant-lite loans, we are ‘cleaning
house’ by seeing the realities of long-troubled business rise to
the surface,&quot; Stuart said in an email. &quot;That and normal sector
volatility are driving this current cycle.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans in general are not currently happy with their state of
finances. A new &lt;a href=&quot;https://americanstaffing.net/asa-workforce-monitor/paycheck-inflation/&quot;&gt;ASA Workforce
Monitor study from the American Staffing Association and The Harris
Poll&lt;/a&gt; found that 53% of respondents said their paychecks were
not keeping up with inflation. Additionally, 38% said their overall
financial situation was more stressful than it was a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The data may project a soft landing for the economy, but the
bank accounts of America’s workers are telling a different story,”
said ASA CEO Richard Wahlquist, in a statement with the poll
results. “U.S. workers are stressed about the adequacy of their
paychecks and their ability to save for their future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results come at a time when inflation has fallen from its
pandemic-era high. In 2021, annual inflation was about 7%,
declining to 6.5% in 2022 and 3.2% in 2023, according to the Labor
Department. At the same time, according to the Bureau of Economic
Analysis, wages on average grew 6.7% in 2023 compared to the year
before, up from a 5% annual growth rate seen in 2022. Those
wage-growth rates are higher than the rates seen before the
pandemic, and experts say wage growth likely will remain at a pace
that's at least slightly elevated over pre-pandemic levels.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>A preference for “trophy” office space has been cited frequently as a key driver of corporate real estate decisions post-pandemic, but more than building amenities are playing into companies' choices.</description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A preference for the newest, so-called &quot;trophy&quot; office space has
been frequently cited as a key driver of corporate decision-making
when it comes to business sites, especially since the Covid-19
pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That preference may ultimately be less about which buildings
offer the best fitness or conference centers and instead be more
about where those buildings are located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stay on top of the latest real estate news
by&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/newsletters&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;signing up here for The National Observer: Real Estate
Edition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This flight-to-quality narrative may be a bit played out at
this point, or at least it seems to be used in an incorrect way by
some,&quot; said Thomas LaSalvia, head of commercial real estate
economics at Moody's Analytics Inc., during a forecast event last
week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;To me, this evolution in office is more about metros and
neighborhoods — where buildings, regardless of class, are either
going to do quite well over the next few years or they’re going to
become obsolete,&quot; LaSalvia said. &quot;It really turns out that the old
saying 'location, location, location' is still incredibly valuable,
and maybe more than ever in this asset class, as we move toward
employees wanting to be in vibrant neighborhoods, where there
actually are amenities even outside of what that Class A building
can provide.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up email, LaSalvia said no large-scale study has
been done to underscore a flight-to-neighborhood preference versus
tenants picking the newest or most amenitized buildings in a market
independent of location. But he cited the Penn Station submarket in
Manhattan — which includes the massive Hudson Yards mixed-use
development and district — as an example of the trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to other submarkets like Midtown South, Midtown West
and South Broadway, the Penn Station submarket is outperforming on
effective rent — with a year-over-year gain of 6.5% compared to
3.6% or less in six other Manhattan office submarkets, according to
Moody's. It has a vacancy rate of 9.4% compared to double-digit
vacancy in other nearby submarkets, and had positive absorption of
more than 2 million square feet in 2023, according to LaSalvia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based Wells Fargo &amp; Co. is among the companies
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2023/11/28/wells-fargo-hudson-yards.html&quot;&gt;that have expanded their office footprint&lt;/a&gt; at
Hudson Yards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the newest buildings in a given office market are being
developed or are finishing construction in the most desirable
neighborhoods, which may mean, in some cases, the flight-to-quality
and flight-to-neighborhood trend look one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the picture likely is more nuanced than that and may
ultimately hinge on the dynamics of a specific municipality or
submarket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent report by Commercial Edge, part of Yardi Systems Inc.,
found average office rental rates for Class A and A-plus space
decreased by 2% between January 2023 and January 2024, to $45.78
per square foot. At the same time, Class B office rates edged up
0.4%, to $30.22 per square foot, while Class C properties saw an
increase of 5.7%, to $23.23 year-over-year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that same time period, rents at suburban office properties
increased 0.3%, to $30.56 per square foot, on an annual basis.
Rents for Central Business District office spaces dropped 7.3%, to
$47.70 per square foot, while rates at urban offices fell 0.5%, to
$43.53 per square foot year-over-year, according to Commercial
Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, a recent analysis by commercial real estate data
company CompStak Inc. found effective rents for New York's &quot;prime&quot;
Class A office space — considered to be new construction, trophy
space or a property that was recently renovated — are up from 2019
on the whole but dipped in the past two quarters. Effective rents
for that so-called prime Class A office space are up 18.8% from the
2019 quarterly average, compared to 2023 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts focused on both the office market and the revitalization
of downtowns say companies today want to be in specific
neighborhoods, and those locations are less likely to be a
traditional financial district or office-dominant Central Business
District than in years past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some city and economic-development officials &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2024/02/21/downtowns-central-business-districts-rebrand.html&quot;&gt;are abandoning the term CBD altogether&lt;/a&gt; in favor
of emphasizing a diversity of uses and draws to the urban core
instead.&lt;/p&gt;
