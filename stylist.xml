      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once only referred to as ‘The Change’ in hushed tones, the conversation surrounding <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/prepare-menopause-30s/695568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">menopause</a> has opened up considerably. While it’s encouraging that society has cottoned on to the fact that women don’t just disappear after 50, there’s still a lot we <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/menopause-endometriosis-treatment/714301" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">don’t know about menopause</a>.</p>
<p>And with questions such as ‘Will I have the same menopause as my mother?’, ‘Will I go through menopause at the same age as my mother?’ and ‘How much of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/early-menopause-genetic-risks-signs-symptoms/825178" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">menopause is genetic</a>?’ all ranking high on Google search, it’s clear that many of us are concerned that our own experiences will mimic those of our mother’s.</p>
<p>When I asked my mum about her <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/perimenopause-fertility-get-pregnant/831722" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">menopause journey</a>, she quickly put my mind at ease: “If there’s any truth to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/menopause-treatment-black-asian-women/718370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">menopause symptoms</a> being hereditary, you should be in for an easy ride. Or a fairly easy one, at least.” </p>
<p>Somewhat reassured, I still want to know just how much I can base my future on my mum’s experience. And what about the women who weren’t as fortunate as my mum – and perhaps, therefore, me? </p>
<p>Tess is one such woman who feels frightened about how her mum’s negative menopause experience might predict her own.</p>
<p>“Mum’s menopause came on in her mid-50s,” she tells <i>Strong Women</i>. “In hindsight, I realise that she had no real idea what was happening. She has no sisters and her mum died young… we didn’t know what she was going through either.</p>
<p>“I remember coming back from a study year abroad, and she appeared to be really ill. She’d convinced herself that the hot sweats and disordered thinking was malaria, as my dad had recurring bouts of it from his time in India and the symptoms seemed similar. The local GP eventually refused to see her as he became so frustrated with her theory, so she was left to struggle on with iron pills and the offer of valium. This was the late 80s when they could do such things.”</p>

<p>Tess says that because menopause was such a taboo subject both societally and at home, her mum was left to struggle alone for years. She now wonders if that fact played some role in her mother’s early onset Alzheimer’s diagnosis.</p>
<p>“Fast forward to more enlightened times, I was very conscious of how the menopause might affect me, particularly as I’d had bad postpartum depression. As soon as symptoms like brain fog, hot sweats and insomnia started to arise, I got myself assessed and prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT). That has kept my brain and body functioning so that my family don’t find themselves living with a stranger.” </p>
<p>Lianne, 37, relates to Tess’s worries. “The women on my mum’s side of the family always seem to suffer horrifically with their symptoms and end up having a hysterectomy,” she says. “I’m just at the start of my perimenopause journey but as I have PCOS, I know that it’s only a matter of time until the symptoms really rear their head.”</p>
<p>And while others may not suffer with exactly the same symptoms as their mothers, they’ve found themselves beginning the process at roughly the same age. Anna, now 41, began having menopausal symptoms aged 38 – two years earlier than when her mum’s periods “turned off like a tap” at age 40. </p>

<p>“At the time, mum didn’t think it could be menopause. She thought she was pregnant so went to the doctor a number of times,” explains Anna, now a coach for menopausal women looking to navigate their careers through the period. </p>
<p>“She was always very open about her experience and it deepened my awareness of what to expect. But despite telling my doctor this history when I began suffering debilitating symptoms at 38, I was still considered ‘too young’ to be menopausal. It took 10 months to be diagnosed and treated.”</p>
<p>Despite her mum sharing her experiences, Anna says that she “really wasn’t prepared for the impact symptoms would have” on her career or as a mother to two small daughters. “The only similarity between me and mum was our age: my mum experienced the more physical side of menopause – particularly hot flushes. For me, anxiety was the most prominent symptom. </p>
<p>“When it began four years ago, I lost all my confidence, experienced nightly insomnia and palpitations alongside headaches, flooding, bloating and mood swings.” </p>
<h2><\h2><p>While the anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that there is some truth that symptoms are hereditary, what does the science say? Are we really all ‘doomed’ (or blessed) to follow the same patterns as our mothers? </p>
<p>Dr Semiya Aziz, a GP, says that menopause and the symptoms accompanying it are influenced by a myriad of factors – not just your genes. </p>
<p>“Your personal health is a factor, including diet, exercise regimes, sleep routines, relaxation measures and habits such as drinking and smoking. Even your life circumstances come into play, as we know that stress can make everything in the menopause much worse,” she reveals. </p>
<p>“While there is no definite way of predicting the age at which menopause begins or vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) may occur, there may be a hereditary component – but this differs across races and ethnic groups, suggesting that the symptoms of menopause that women experience may be affected by multiple genes.”</p>
<p>According to <i>The Study Of Women’s Health Across The Nation</i> – a multiethnic, longitudinal, cohort <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2217/17455057.5.2.127#:~:text=Most%20symptoms%20varied%20by%20ethnicity,is%20protective%20against%20vasomotor%20symptoms." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study of US women</a> that includes non-Hispanic Caucasian, African-American, Chinese, Japanese and Hispanic women – vasomotor symptoms were more prevalent in African-American and Hispanic women and were also more common in women with a greater BMI. Vaginal dryness was present in 30-40% of participants, and was most prevalent in Hispanic women.</p>
<h2><\h2><h3>Lifestyle factors</h3>
<p>Dr Aziz continues: “You might have an earlier menopause if you smoke, if you live at a high altitude, have undergone certain types of surgery or radiotherapy to the pelvic area or have taken some types of chemotherapy drugs.”
	  </p>
<h3>Menopause anxiety</h3>
<p>She adds that taking note of what your mother went through might “create a self-fulfilling prophecy and influence the symptoms you may begin to experience during your menopause”.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the understanding of genetic factors that influence women’s health and their menopausal experience remains limited – but just like no two humans are the same, every woman’s menopause experience will be unique to her body make-up.</p>
<p>“From the limited evidence we have on genetics, it is clear that our mother’s menopause isn’t always a predictor of what our menopausal experience will be,” she concludes.</p>
<h3>Inherited habits</h3>
<p>Sarah Williamson, a nutritional therapist, menopause expert and co-founder of WomenWise, agrees with Dr Aziz. “Often the timings of menopause are similar, as can be found in the <i>Genetics Of Early And Normal Menopause</i> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26569518/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a>,” she says. </p>
<p>“However, most often, similarities exist because we keep many of the habits passed on to us by our culture and family upbringing, such as those around diet and exercise. Our genetics only account for a tiny percentage of our experience – so understanding your genetics and then making changes is a really powerful tool when it comes to menopause.”</p>
<h3>Insulin sensitivity</h3>
<p>She says that underlying health is the biggest factor affecting the menopause journey. “In particular, your level of insulin sensitivity (your ability to fuel your cells rather than preferentially storing food as fat) and your stress resistance are two key markers we look at,” Williamson explains. “Low iron levels and low thyroid function can mimic menopausal symptoms of fatigue, low mood and thinning hair – so ruling those out is important.”</p>
<p>In other words, it’s likely that the menopause experience we will go through is only tenuously linked to our genetics – which might come as a relief to women like Lianne and Tess, whose mums had a tough time.</p>
<h2><\h2><p><a href="https://www.georginasturmer.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgina Sturmer</a>, an MBACP counsellor specialising in helping women to navigate this transition, tells <i>Strong Women: </i>“It’s crucial that the voices of women who are worried about a family history of bad menopause are heard. Don’t suppress these fears – explore them. They might be linked to your memories of how you experienced your own mum when she was going through menopause. The good news is that society is better equipped these days to support women through menopause. Openness is more encouraged, and treatment has become more sophisticated.”</p>
<p>And while there may be little we can do to stop the inevitable, there are thankfully ways we can try to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/menopause-mental-health/724099" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alleviate some of the symptoms</a> and break the cycle of yet another generation suffering the same menopause as their mum. </p>

<h3>Eat a plant-rich diet</h3>
<p>According to Dr Aziz, several studies show that healthier dietary patterns (eg a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/mediterranean-diet-omega-3-benefits/487376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mediterranean-style diet</a>) may help to reduce the frequency and severity of vasomotor systems, as well as help to manage body weight and body shape changes that menopause can cause. </p>
<p>“The evidence suggests that incorporating a diet that is rich in fruit and vegetables, whole grains, beans and other pulses, and has a higher proportion of healthier fats from foods such as oily fish, nuts and seeds, may help with symptoms,” she continues. </p>
<p>“And certain foods and drinks can trigger and worsen menopausal symptoms. For example, it is suggested to steer clear of spicy foods that often contain the heat-producing compound capsaicin, which makes hot flushes worse. Both caffeine and alcohol can increase blood flow to the skin and can make you feel flushed, so it may be worth considering swapping your morning coffee for a herbal tea.”</p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Keep on exercising</h3>
<p>“A variety of different types of exercise, including cardio workouts, resistance and weight training and gentle pilates or yoga, may be beneficial,” she says. “A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5341707/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> at Liverpool John Moores University found that women who followed a gym-based 16-week exercise programme developed fewer hot flushes compared with a group who did not exercise. One theory behind this was that being physically active could make your internal temperature controls more efficient.”</p>
<h3>Prioritise relaxation and stress relief</h3>
<p>Relaxation measures – such as mindfulness and meditation – can help in lowering the stress hormone cortisol, which may have several beneficial metabolic effects within the body, as well as helping aid sleep. </p>
<p>Williamson adds: “We can absolutely break the menopause cycle earlier in our lives. It’s a natural transition… it doesn’t have to be a car crash. Getting things like <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/bloating-hormones-gut-health/766963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gut imbalances</a> and mood issues sorted before you reach the transition will be very powerful.”</p>
<p>Dr Aziz concludes: “Benefits may be gained by <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/prepare-menopause-30s/695568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ramping up your diet</a>, exercise programme and taking some ‘me time’ in your 30s, as it may be that you will suffer fewer menopausal effects in the future. It’s never too early to start.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve got over 50 different hormones travelling around the bloodstream at any one time. Many of us blame random teary outbursts on them, but the truth is, we quite literally couldn’t live without our hormones. And for us to feel happy and healthy, hormones need to be balanced; most of them affect our mental health in some way or another.</p>
<p>But just how simple is the link between <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/balance-your-hormones/666270" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hormonal balance</a> and mental health? If we’re struggling with low mood, is that necessarily linked to a hormonal mismatch? And if we’re experiencing an imbalance, is that necessarily going to result in an altered mental state?</p>
<h2><\h2><p>Hormones like <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/cortisol-levels-how-to-reduce-exercise-benefits/407711" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cortisol</a>, serotonin and oestrogen all play a huge role in how we’re feeling, and their levels constantly fluctuate throughout the day.</p>
<p>“Raised levels of the stress hormone cortisol can affect neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to imbalances in serotonin - your happy brain hormones,” explains Dr Shirin Lakhani of <a href="https://www.elite-aesthetics.co.uk/dr-shirin-lakhani/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elite Aesthetics</a> and a speaker at <a href="http://www.pauselive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pause! Live</a>.</p>
<p>“This causes an imbalance in the adrenal glands; when cortisol levels go up, less testosterone is made and that lowers libido. Lower levels of oestrogen (the female sex hormone) can also cause mood swings, brain fog, irritability and depression.”  </p>
<h2><\h2><p>Although we all have the same hormones, how much you produce of certain types will depend on your sex. Females might experience hormonal imbalances on a monthly basis as part of the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/does-pms-get-worse-older/723439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reproductive cycles</a>, when using birth control or during pregnancy, perimenopause and the menopause. </p>
<p>However, sleep also plays a huge role in the normal functioning of the endocrine system, which explains why we often feel grumpy and hungry when we’re tired. </p>
<p>“Many hormones are dependent on the sleep-wake cycle, so not sleeping properly can cause hormonal imbalance,” advises Dr Lakhani. </p>
<p>“When you sleep, your cortisol levels naturally decrease. However, when you don’t get enough sleep they remain elevated, leading to lower levels of serotonin and testosterone.” </p>

<p><a href="http://www.rjlbpcs.com/article-pdf-downloads/2018/18/221.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research</a> shows that hormonal imbalance can also cause sleep disturbance, creating a vicious cycle. It can also affect our menstrual cycle, fertility, appetite and metabolism.
	  </p>
<h2><\h2><p>Low mood and anxiety are both common symptoms of hormonal imbalance, as well as sleep disruption, fatigue, trouble concentrating and changes in appetite. </p>
<p>“However, these symptoms can overlap with other conditions, so it’s important to diagnose the root cause of the problem,” advises Dr Bruce Dorr, senior medical advisor for <a href="https://biote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biote</a>. “Different symptoms of hormonal imbalance manifest for each patient and the frequency and intensity of symptoms vary as well.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/long-reads/pmdd-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-working-from-home-wfh-periods-pain-pms-gynaecological-health/418417" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PMDD</a> (premenstrual dysphoric disorder) is the more extreme version of PMS, which may be caused by changing hormone levels.</p>
<p>“There’s still little research around PMDD, but it’s thought that lower levels of oestrogen can occur during the luteal phase of the cycle, which happens around day 15 when the uterine lining begins to thicken,” explains Dr Lakhani.</p>
<p>“This can lead to increased appetite, depression, irritability, fatigue, headaches and trouble concentrating.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>In the first instance, if you feel persistently unwell or suspect hormonal imbalance, you should always speak to your GP, who can make a formal diagnosis, with a blood test being the most common way to check. However, there are lifestyle changes we can all make that help to keep hormones in balance and our general health in check. (And no, it’s not as simple as eating raw carrot salad, as some TikTokkers would have you believe…).</p>
<p>“There are many things in life that we can’t control – genetics, relationships, job/work stress—so what we can do is make sure that we are optimal in the areas that we can control,” advises Dr Dorr.</p>
<p>“Getting exercise – even if it’s just walking daily – and connecting with other people helps establish feelings of balance.</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Women doing yoga at home" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/07092929/gettyimages-1426186272-1120x1120.jpg">

</figure>
<p>“Adequate sleep helps hormone restoration and resetting the mind, so we should avoid triggers before bedtime like computers, television and phones in order to get our best sleep.”</p>
<p>Dr Dorr also recommends “avoiding inflammatory and highly processed foods” in a bid to bolster the hormone receptors we have  throughout our body. </p>
<p>“Fluctuations in glucose levels can be similar to those associated with anxiety and depression. Increasing good fats in our diets, such as essential fatty acids (found in oily fish and chia seeds), can help to reduce depressive symptoms, as up to 80% of our brain is made up of these compounds.”</p>
<p>These all might seem easy on paper, but our busy lives often mean that something as simple as going to bed at a sensible hour can be a struggle. So, if you’re feeling overwhelmed, try making one small adjustment at a time. And remember, it’s always a good idea to speak to a medical professional rather than self-diagnosing. Mood, mental health and hormones are complicated areas and you’re far more likely to rebalance the books by being properly assessed.</p>
<p>“Hormone imbalance can cause a wide range of symptoms and many people may be suffering without realising it’s due to a hormonal issue,” advises Dr Lakhani.</p>
<p>“However, there may be other causes of the symptoms so it’s important that you’re properly diagnosed in order to obtain the correct treatment.” </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s no secret that bread has been subject to a barrage of bad press, with diet culture having hammered home the message that it poses a threat to healthy eating for years.  </p>
</p>
<p>Luckily, we’re in something of a pro-bread era. Just look at the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/food/walnut-grapes-ricotta-sourdough-recipe/674042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sourdough obsession</a> that started in lockdown; we might not be making it anymore, but every high street seems to now have a bakery offering it. Fancy sandwiches are huge on social media these days. Flatbreads seem to be <i>the</i> side dish these days.</p>
</p>
<p>And aside from being delicious, filling and (outside of east London) quite cheap, there’s probably one main reason that bread just keeps coming back into fashion: it’s healthy. Along with other high-fibre foods, it’s a diet staple for the longest-living people in the world who can be found in what’s called the ‘blue zones’.</p>
<p>In Ikaria and Sardinia (two Greek blue zone islands), for example, breads are made from a variety of whole grains such as wheat, rye or barley – each of which offers a bucket-load of nutrients (but more on that later).  
	  </p>
<p>“Bread made from whole grains is a good source of essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals (including iron, magnesium and selenium) and antioxidants,” says Lisa Marley, a nutrition coach and sustainable plant-based chef.  </p>
</p>
<p>Bread is also mostly made up of carbohydrates, which are your body’s primary source of readily available energy. Wholegrain, in particular, also contains fibre – two slices contain around 4.5g or around 15% of the daily recommended amount. And those slices are rich in key minerals including magnesium, iron, zinc, vitamin B3 and folate.  </p>

</figure>
<p>“<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/fibre-health-benefits/408155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fibre is good for many areas of health</a>, including reducing the risk of heart disease, and it’s involved in energy metabolism and a healthy nervous system,” explains Rob Hobson, a consultant nutritionist at Healthspan.  </p>
</p>
<p>The fibre, antioxidants and other compounds found in whole grains have been shown to lower cholesterol levels, decrease blood pressure and improve overall heart health.</p>
<h2><\h2><p>So, yes, bread boasts a load of nutritional benefits. Even with interest in gut health and fibre on the rise, people still seem to demonise the humble loaf. Here are some of the most common yeasty myths and the truth behind them:
	  </p>
<h3>Bread is nutritionally empty </h3>
<p>While refined white bread doesn’t rank too high when it comes to nutrition, that doesn’t mean it’s devoid of goodness altogether.  </p>
</p>
<p>“White bread contains a good source of certain nutrients as the white flour is fortified [the process of deliberately increasing the content of one or more micronutrients] to account for the nutrients lost through processing of the flour,” confirms Hobson.  </p>
</p>
<p>Two medium slices of white bread still contain calcium, iron and folate, for example.  </p>
<h3>Gluten is inflammatory</h3>
<p>Gluten causes problems for <i>some</i> people; coeliac disease affects around 1% of the population and symptoms include bloating, gas, constipation and pain in the abdomen. For those people, it’s definitely best to avoid gluten, but “the majority of people can tolerate it without any issues”, says Marley. Gluten sensitivity is also a thing and while uncomfortable, it isn’t anywhere near as dangerous as coeliac disease. </p>
<p>Unless you’ve got symptoms that can be directly correlated to eating gluten, it’s not a good idea to cut it out as doing so can lead to stressful and unnecessary restriction as well as potentially missing out on vital nutrients.</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Seedy sandwiches" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/09/19171456/gettyimages-1220390518-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Whole grain is the same as wholewheat</h3>
<p>Choosing what bread to buy at the supermarket is enough to give us analysis paralysis – there’s a lot of choice.  </p>
</p>
<p>“Whole grain means that bread can be made from any whole grain kernel such as oats or spelt, whereas wholewheat bread is made from all of the wheat kernels that have been ground down,” explains Marley.  </p>
</p>
<p>The verdict? Go for a seeded whole grain loaf as “it contains more fibre and also good fats from the seeds”, she states.  </p>
<h3>Bread causes digestion issues </h3>
<p>We all know that person who says they can’t digest bread properly, but the truth is, if you’re eating a slice, you’re already looking after your gut nicely. “Whole grain varieties of bread are high in fibre, which can support a healthy gut through better transit of waste via the colon and help gut bacteria to flourish,” Hobson explains.</p>
</p>
<p>That said, conditions such as IBS can be more difficult to manage and it’s probably a good idea to talk to your GP or a nutritionist about ways in which you might be able to enjoy bread without any adverse issues.</p>
<h2><\h2><p>You’re not going to have time to scan the labels on every loaf in the supermarket, so to make it easier, Hobson recommends buying “a good quality wholemeal loaf that’s been freshly baked rather than something overly processed with a long shelf life and extensive ingredient list”.</p>
</p>
<p class="">Marley agrees, and suggests a whole grain sourdough loaf. Because bread contains starchy carbohydrates, you may experience a rise in your blood glucose after eating it (which is a completely normal response), making you feel tired and lethargic. But sourdough tends to cause a slightly smaller glucose spike compared to regular bread. That’s because the fermentation process in sourdough bread helps break down complex carbohydrates, making them easier to digest.</p>
<p>“This slower digestion process helps avoid rapid spikes in blood sugar levels and provides a more sustained release of energy, which can help with maintaining stable energy levels throughout the day,” states Marley.</p>
<p>However, sourdough still contains starch, which inevitably <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/glucose-glycogen/654461" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heightens blood sugar</a>. To stabilise the spikes, team your slices with protein, fats and fibrous toppings like egg and avocado, baked beans or peanut butter and banana.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is there anything more comforting than a plate of creamy, crunchy mac ’n’ cheese? We think not&nbsp;– but it’s hardly the most nutritious dish in the world. This version, however, couldn’t be more full of gut-supporting fibre and probiotics.</p>
<p>Nestling among the macaroni pasta, you’ve got stacks of broccoli (rich in vitamin C and antioxidants), peas (a great source of plant protein) and cavolo nero (full of calcium, fibre and B vitamins). The creamy, cheesy sauce is made using probiotic-rich white miso&nbsp;– known to support the immune system and ward off infections – and lemon, a vitamin C powerhouse.</p>
<p>Want an even bigger nutritional bang for your buck? Once cooked, top this dish with a sprinkling of nutritional yeast, which will boost its vitamin B12 content and make it taste even cheesier.&nbsp;This recipe uses Julienne Bruno cream cheeses, which you can find from various stores like Planet Organic. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>1x Julienne Bruno Crematta™</p>
<p>2x Julienne Bruno Superstraccia®</p>
<p>100g broccoli</p>
<p>40g cavolo nero</p>
<p>50g all purpose flour</p>
<p>500ml water</p>
<p>1 tsp sea salt</p>
<p>½ tsp black pepper</p>
<p>1 tsp mustard powder</p>
<p>1 tsp onion powder</p>
<p>1 tsp garlic powder</p>
<p>1 tsp white miso</p>
<p>1 tsp soy sauce</p>
<p>250g macaroni</p>
<p>100g frozen peas</p>
<p>¼ lemon zest and juice</p>
<p>2 tbsp tapioca starch</p>
<h2><\h2><p>1. Bring a large pan of water to the boil, blanch the broccoli and cavolo nero for 2 minutes then plunge into a large bowl of cold water. Drain then coarsely chop before setting aside.</p>
<p>2. Preheat the oven to 200°C. Spoon out the tub of Crematta into a medium/large pan, and set over a medium heat until it begins to melt. Gently whisk until the Crematta is entirely melted and begins to bubble.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Add the flour, constantly whisking to combine until the flour cooks off and the roux-style base is smooth and glossy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Pour the 500 ml of water into the pan while whisking continuously.</p>
<p>5. Turn down the heat, add half a tub of the Superstraccia and cook for 5 minutes allowing the sauce to thicken, whisking occasionally.</p>
<p>6. Add all of the seasonings then whisk vigorously to combine. Remove from the heat before stirring through the chopped greens, peas, lemon juice, lemon zest and macaroni.</p>
<p>7. Spoon the macaroni mixture into your oven dish or skillet. Mix together remaining Superstraccia with the tapioca starch before evenly topping the dish, ensuring it is spread completely to the edges.</p>
<p>8. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes until bubbling, and the top is golden.</p>
<p>9. Finish under the grill on high heat for 5 minutes until the top is beautifully browned and beginning to char. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="button" href="https://viewfinder.flexmr.net/oa/4949ab">View</a><p>Another day, another TikTok health trend. This time, it’s carrot juice that’s being heralded as a golden elixir, with the #CarrotJuice hashtag getting well over 45 million views. Videos on the platform claim the juice is “<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/how-to-improve-your-gut-health-healing-hacks-tiktok/656629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gut healing</a>”, “immunity boosting”, “<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/hormone-habits-health-free-mind-body-wellbeing/795045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hormone balancing</a>” and can “leave skin glowing”. It’s enough to have you raiding Bugs Bunny’s lunchbox and making for the nearest Nutribullet.  </p>
</p>
<p>But is this drink really the magic health potion TikTok believes it to be? We asked the experts to talk us through the real benefits of carrot juice and look at just how much we should be drinking to optimise our health. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>“Carrot juice is rich in vitamins A, C and K, as well as minerals like potassium and manganese. These nutrients are essential for overall health, our immunity and for supporting healthy skin, nails and hair,” certified nutritionist <a href="https://adelejohnstoncoaching.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adele Johnson</a> tells <i>Strong Women</i>. “Carrots are also packed with antioxidants including beta-carotene, which may help protect cells from damage and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.” </p>
</p>
<p>The health benefits of this juice can be boosted with the addition of ingredients such as ginger and orange. “Ginger is known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-nausea properties, while oranges add vitamin C, boosting your immune system in a quick and convenient way,” adds Johnson. </p>
</p>
<p>To optimise the benefits further, it’s a good idea to select organic carrots for juicing. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/fruit-vegetables-pesticides-food-study-b1929040.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the Pesticide Action Network</a>, carrots are one of the UK’s 12 most polluted fruits and vegetables due to their ability to absorb pesticides. If you can afford them, choosing organic might help to reduce your consumption of bug-killing chemicals.</p></p>

🕷️" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7130316495522925318?refer=embed">♬ original sound - 🕷️</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script><p>Alexander Thompson, senior nutritionist at <a href="https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holland & Barrett</a>, believes consuming carrots in juice form is often a better option than eating them cooked. </p>
<p>“Cooking carrots will result in some losses to vitamin and mineral content, although this effect can be mitigated by choosing cooking methods such as steaming, stir-frying or by adding a source of fat, such as vegetable oil or butter, to improve absorption of the vitamin A content,” he explains.</p>
</p>
<p>“Raw carrot juice retains the full vitamin and mineral content, but juicing <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/smoothies-vs-juices/578762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strips away the beneficial fibre content</a>.” </p>
<p>And this is where social media’s carrot juice claims start to sound a little empty… </p>
<h2><\h2><p>“Whole carrots have been found to have a prebiotic role, meaning the fibre found within carrots is a good source of fuel for the beneficial bacteria that resides within the gut. Furthermore, black and purple varieties of carrot also provide plant compounds called polyphenols, which also provide prebiotic effects,” explains Thompson. </p>
</p>
<p>But this applies to fibre-rich whole carrots. As soon as you juice them, which <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/fibre-health-benefits/408155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">removes almost all the crucial fibre</a>, the related gut health benefits are almost entirely removed too. </p>
<section class="pp-article__boxout">
<div id="boxout_1" class="pp-boxout" style="background-color:#606060;">
<div class="pp-boxout__body">
<h4>Juicing removes all the crucial gut-healthy fibre</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<h2><\h2><p>As for the TikTok claims that carrot juice is good for balancing hormones, Thompson reiterates the links with gut health: “In terms of supporting hormonal health, the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/how-probiotics-work/415359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prebiotic effects</a> of the fibre in carrots helps to support a healthy gut microbiome, which may then help to support normal oestrogen levels. However, this effect is not exclusive to carrots and the best overall effects will be achieved through ingesting a wide variety of whole fruit and vegetables.” </p>
</p>
<p>When it comes to supporting hormones at other life stages, Johnson says that “while carrot juice is generally good for overall wellbeing, it may not have a specific effect related to hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle or perimenopause – drinking it won’t replace decreasing hormones”.</p>
</p>
<p>It looks like TikTok’s carrot juice fans have pounced on the health benefits of whole carrots and assumed they apply to carrots in any form. While raw whole carrots do contain the fibre needed to support hormones and gut health, this is missing in its juiced form – any claims that carrot juice does the same for our health as a whole carrot is a misleading leap too far. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>You may have heard scary stories about <a href="https://www.msdmanuals.com/en-gb/professional/nutritional-disorders/vitamin-deficiency,-dependency,-and-toxicity/vitamin-a-toxicity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vitamin A toxicity</a>, and while it’s true that a high intake can cause nausea, dizziness, blurred vision and severe headaches, it’s usually via certain medicines or supplements. The vitamin A from carrots is created by the body converting carotenoids into vitamin A – and as the body is able to regulate this, toxicity isn’t usually an issue where carrots are concerned. </p>
</p>
<p>However, too many carotenoids will have one particularly interesting effect. You may have spotted ‘the carrot tan’ trend on TikTok gaining millions of views. Like rabbits possessed, white TikTokers are chomping their way through bags of carrots and gulping down carrot juice on the regular to achieve what they believe to be a sun-kissed glow. </p></p>

Johnson explains: “Excessive consumption of beta-carotene can cause a condition called carotenemia, turning the skin orange-yellow – but this is not dangerous.” </p>
</p>
<p>Drink or crunch through a sensible amount and carrot’s high beta-carotene content can be particularly beneficial for eye health. “It can reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration and improve night vision, which many women note deteriorates in the menopause years,’ she adds. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>Both experts recommend carrot juice for its vitamin and mineral content, but that it should be considered as one part of a varied diet full of whole foods. </p>
</p>
<p>“Drinking carrot juice can be a tasty and easy way to get more of your weekly intake of nutrients, but it’s important to maintain a well-rounded diet containing a variety of fruits and vegetables,” says Johnson.</p>
</p>
<p>And Thompson is keen to stress the fibre point: “While carrot juice is a great way to get essential vitamins and minerals into your diet, the juice form can contain less fibre than eating the whole vegetable. Limit your intake of carrot juice to one small glass a day and make sure that you support this with plenty of other fruits and vegetables throughout the day too.” </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ottessa Moshfegh’s debut novel,<i> Eileen</i>, was one of the biggest hits of 2015. Now, the shocking tale of a young woman’s dark obsessions and fantasies is <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/film/anne-hathaway-eileen-film-plot-cast-trailer/825834" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coming to the big screen</a>. Directed by <i>Lady Macbeth’s</i> William Oldroyd and produced and written by <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/ottessa-moshfegh-maryam-nassir-zadeh-new-york-fashion-week/623696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moshfegh</a> herself, the film is just as darkly intriguing and stomach-turning as the novel. With its muted palette and mesmerising score by Arcade Fire’s Reed Parry, the film has a stylish old <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/hollywood" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood</a> noir feel that lures you in from the first moments.</p>
<p>We follow Eileen (Thomasin McKenzie), a young, lonely woman who works in a New England correctional facility for boys, as she goes about her day. On the outside, she appears dull and quiet, maybe a little boring, even. However, her inner life is filled with lurid sexual and morbid fantasies that occasionally flash vividly before us on the screen. When a glamorous new psychologist, Dr Rebecca St. John (<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/anne-hathaway-hathahate-hollywood-sexism-misogyny/635951" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anne Hathaway</a>), comes to the prison, Eileen becomes obsessed with her. Things take a sinister turn when the pair become embroiled in a crime.</p>
<p>Whether you’re already a fan of Moshfegh’s novel or not, this film promises to draw you in and keep you there. Here are <i>Stylist’s</i> five takeaways from the film. </p>
<h3>1. This Eileen isn’t <i>quite</i> the gross girl from the novel.</h3>
<p>When <i>Eileen </i>first hit the shelves, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/books/2022s-biggest-book-trend-women-on-the-edge/619958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">readers</a> were taken aback by <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/how-often-wash-hair-change-sheets-hygiene-confessions/833538" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just how disgusting</a> its titular character is. She catalogues her bowel movements in a diary. She indulges in depraved thoughts about the boys at the facility where she works. Her home is filthy. </p>
<p>“I looked so boring, lifeless, immune and unaffected, but in truth I was always furious, seething, my thoughts racing, my mind like a killer’s,” reads the novel. “It was easy to hide behind the dull face I wore, moping around. I really thought I had everybody fooled. And I didn’t really read books about flowers or home economics. I liked books about awful things — murder, illness, death.” Or just take: “Any function of the body that one hid behind closed doors titillated me. I recall one of my early relationships – not a heavy love affair, just a light one – was with a Russian man with a wonderful sense of humour who permitted me to squeeze the pus from his pimples on his back and shoulders. To me, this was the greatest intimacy.”</p>
<p>As Moshfegh put it in an interview with <i><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wd7b3m/eileen-author-ottessa-moshfegh-on-phoniness-power-and-aligning-yourself-with-rich-white-people-1120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vice</a></i>: “My writing lets people scrape up against their own depravity, but at the same time it’s very refined – the depth of it hides behind its sophistication.”</p>
<p>In the film, we get glimpses of this grotesque depravity that made Moshfegh’s novel so popular. However, it’s not quite the disgusting Eileen we met in the book. While we do see her having sexual fantasies and stumbling around after a heavy night of drinking, vomit caked in her hair, the grime of the novel is never fully realised. Instead, <i>Eileen</i> manages to remain just a little too aesthetic. If you’re a fan of the novel, you may find yourself clamouring for even more depravity – and that’s saying something.</p>
<h3>2. This film captures queer obsession perfectly.</h3>
<p>One of the most captivating parts of the film is the complexity of Eileen’s obsession with Rebecca. She is constantly drawn to her. Soon, she is mimicking her movements, her turns of phrase and even the way she holds her cigarette. While it would be easy to explain this as a simple crush, the film captures just how deep Eileen’s fascination goes. It’s as though the character can’t decide if she want to be <i>with</i> her or wants to <i>be </i>her. </p>
<p>Although things take a very dark turn for Eileen and Rebecca – theirs is not exactly a love story – anyone who has ever felt this kind of pull will recognise their feelings playing out on screen. </p>

<h3>3. This film is perfect for fans of Carol – but only if you’re up for a very dark twist.</h3>
<p>In an interview with <i><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/01/eileen-ottessa-moshfegh-anne-hathaway-sundance-first-look?utm_social-type=owned&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_brand=vf&mbid=social_twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a></i>, Hathaway compared <i>Eileen </i>to Todd Haynes’s <i>Carol</i>, saying, it’s “<i>Carol</i> meets <i>Reservoir Dogs</i>”. It’s easy to see why she made the comparison. Like <i>Carol</i>, <i>Eileen</i> tells the story of a relatively naive girl who becomes enthralled by a wiser, older, more glamorous woman. In both, the pair gaze at each other through a mist of cigarette smoke as jazz music hums in the background. Then, both romances take a turn. Carol and Therese go on the run to escape Carol’s husband. Eileen and Rebecca become involved in a crime. Fans of <i>Carol </i>will almost certainly love <i>Eileen</i>. Just be prepared for a much darker twist, and we can’t promise any happy endings. </p>
<h3>4. Eileen has a subtle feminist message.</h3>
<p>While <i>Eileen</i> may be about obsession and desire, it’s also about a girl who is trapped under the thumb of a difficult parent. Eileen lives with her father, an ex-police officer and alcoholic, who is hyper-critical of her, expecting her to be his housekeeper and carer now that her mother is dead. It is, he suggests, her job as a woman. Throughout the film, Eileen has fantasies about murdering her father. </p>
<p>While it may be an excessively dark story, it serves as a reminder of how stifling life as a woman could be at the time (the book is set in 1964). Indeed, many women will <i>still</i> relate to the feeling that they are expected to balance both work and household tasks, often without much thanks.</p>
<h3>5. The Anne Hathaway renaissance is here.<br />
	  </h3>
<p>If you need any more encouragement to see <i>Eileen</i>, I have two words for you: <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/anne-hathaway" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anne Hathaway</a>. Hathaway is fantastic as the worldly, charming Rebecca. It’s easy to see why Eileen is instantly drawn to her. </p>
<p>However, the character also opens up into something that goes much deeper than the wry, glamorous facade we see at the beginning and we get to see Hathaway flirting, scheming, calculating and, eventually, having a full-blown freakout. She’s at her best here, and we couldn’t be more thrilled to announce that the Anne Hathaway renaissance is officially here.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s a reason why a bag of peas should be a staple in every freezer – and it’s not just because they’re handy for nursing any bumps or scrapes. </p>
<p>The humble pea is a nutritional powerhouse: it contains almost all the 13 essential vitamins that the body needs to function – including vitamins C, E, zinc and thiamine – as well as being a good source of fibre and plant-based protein.</p>
<p>This recipe from <a href="https://peas.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yes Peas!</a> contains a whopping 300g of frozen peas, so you can rest easy in the knowledge that you’ll be taking in plenty of goodness. </p>
<p>The word ‘larb’ means ‘chopped up’ in Thai, and while the dish traditionally contains some kind of minced meat, this recipe brings together peas, toasted rice and shiitake mushrooms to give the lettuce wraps a delicious plant-powered filling.</p>
<p>The best bit? This recipe takes just 25 minutes to make, so you’ll be chowing down on some delicious Thai-flavoured goodness before you know it.  </p>
<h2><\h2><div>
<p>1 tbsp Jasmine rice</p>
<p>2 tbsp vegetable oil</p>
<p>300g shitake mushrooms, sliced</p>
<p>2 shallots, peeled and diced</p>
<p>3cm piece of ginger, peeled and finely grated</p>
<p>2 garlic cloves, crushed</p>
<p>1 tbsp sweet chilli sauce</p>
<p>2 red chillies, chopped</p>
<p>½ tbsp light soy sauce (vegan)</p>
<p>300g frozen peas</p>
<p>4 spring onions, chopped</p>
<p>Handful of roughly chopped coriander</p>
<p>Handful of roughly chopped mint</p>
<p>Juice of 1 lime</p>
<p><b>To serve</b></p>
<p>Little Gem lettuce leaves</p>
<p>Sliced red chilli</p>
<p>Coriander leaves</p>
<p>Jasmine rice</p>
</div>
<h3>Method</h3>
<p>1. In a dry wok or frying pan, toast the rice grains over a medium heat, stirring continuously until golden brown and fragrant. This should take around 6-8 minutes.  Grind the rice to a coarse powder in a pestle and mortar and set aside.</p>
<p>2. Place the wok or frying pan back on the heat.  Add the oil and fry the mushrooms until slightly browned, then add the shallots, ginger, garlic and stir-fry for a further two minutes. </p>
<p>3. Add half the rice powder, sweet chilli sauce, chillies, soy sauce, peas, half the spring onions, chopped coriander and mint leaves, lime juice and season with a little more lime juice and soy if necessary.  Cook for a further minute.</p>
<p>4. Put the pea and mushroom larb into the Little Gem lettuce leaves.  Top with extra chilli, coriander leaves, the remaining rice powder and spring onions and serve with some steamed Jasmine rice.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When was the last time you overrode your body’s <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/brain-food-energy-for-stress/635995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hunger signals</a> and waited just that <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/hangry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">little bit too long to eat</a>? Or maybe you ignored the fact that you’re <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/exhaustion-gap-women-tips/829811" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exhausted</a> and stayed up late again. <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/busy-productivity-difference-stress-burnout/543836" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Life can get busy</a>, so it’s not always practical (or possible) to stop what we’re doing and tend to our physical needs. </p>
<p>Some of us, though, aren’t great when it comes <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/interoception-wellbeing-benefits/620929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to noticing our body’s warning signs</a> – whether it’s the first pangs of hunger or realising that we really could do with popping a jumper on – and this is all to do with our interoception abilities.</p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with the term, it’s a relatively new area of cognitive research. Sometimes referred to as an additional sense, interoception is vital for our mental and physical health – but what exactly is it and how does it affect us? We asked the experts for their take. </p>
<h2><\h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="woman with hands over face and one eye open interoception" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/16165408/self-awareness-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s entirely likely that you’ve never really given much thought to your levels of interoception, but it is a vital life skill – and one that is unique to the individual. </p>
<p>“The easiest way to describe interoception is that it’s the feeling of knowing what is happening in your body,” explains psychotherapist <a href="https://kamalynkaur.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kamalyn Kaur</a>. “Interoception varies widely among individuals. Some of us might naturally have a heightened awareness of internal bodily sensations, while others may be less attuned to them.”</p>
<p>Put simply, interoception is the sense that allows us to understand what is happening inside our bodies – eg hunger, thirst, pain, temperature, heartbeat or the need to go to the toilet. 
	  </p>
<h2><\h2><p>“Interoception allows us to maintain internal balance by enabling us to respond to bodily needs, regulate our emotions and make decisions based on these internal signals,” says Kaur.  “It plays a significant role in shaping how we feel, think and act, allowing us to emotionally regulate as it helps us to recognise and understand the bodily sensations related to our emotions.”</p>
<p>Think about the feelings that accompany anxiety – butterflies in the stomach, an increased heart rate or feeling nauseated – often, our bodies know how we’re feeling before we have had time to process it ourselves. </p>
<h3>1. It helps us to understand ourselves</h3>
<p>“By connecting our physical sensations with feelings and thoughts, interoception allows us to understand ourselves better,” says Kaur. “This increases <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/one-good-thing-emotional-self-awareness/826105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">self-awareness</a> allowing us to connect better with ourselves and others.”</p>
<h3>2. It influences our decision making </h3>
<p>Our behaviour and how we choose to act is heavily influenced by interoception. Our bodily sensations influence our decision-making processes all the time, eg eating when we’re hungry and resting when we’re tired. As such, having a strong sense of interoception is essential for our <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mental health</a>. </p>
<p>“Interoception, when well developed and functioning at optimal levels, supports emotional regulation, healthy decision making and overall wellbeing,” says Kaur. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>So, what happens if we’re not so well-attuned? It’s complicated, according to the experts. It can be helpful to think of our interoception as a dial: turn it up too loud and the noise is all we can hear, but too low and we run the risk of ignoring essential signals. </p>
<p>“When disrupted, interoception can lead to various challenges in understanding and responding to internal bodily cues, impacting our overall wellbeing and daily functioning,” says Kaur. </p>
<h3>Emotional dysregulation </h3>
<p>“You’re likely to find it difficult to recognise and understand your internal body sensations,” says Kaur, “which can manifest in an inability to identify or label emotions accurately, and difficulty understanding physical sensations associated with emotions.”</p>
<h3>A lack of self-awareness</h3>
<p>“As you become disconnected from your own emotions and bodily sensations, you will lack understanding of your own emotional needs,” says Kaur. “This can result in difficulty when making decisions, which can impact various aspects of your home and work life.”</p>
<h3>Health-related issues </h3>
<p>If we’re not in tune with our bodily sensations we can’t respond to them efficiently, and this can have long-term health implications. “If you are missing cues like hunger, thirst, fatigue, stress or tiredness, then this is a recipe for burnout,” warns Kaur. </p>
<h3>Psychological conditions </h3>
<p>“Disrupted interoception has been linked to an increase in <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9220286/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stress</a> and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/depression" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">depression</a>,” says Kaur. “Today’s hectic world is the perfect breeding ground for becoming less and less in tune with ourselves.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>If this all makes for depressing reading, there is some good news. While the interoception dial may be set differently for everyone, we can work on changing it, whether this is turning the dial up or down. </p>
<p>“Interoception varies among individuals due to genetic and neurological factors, life experiences and stress,” explains neurodiversity coach <a href="http://www.GreatMindsDont.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hayley Brackley</a>. “While it’s possible to become more or less attuned to bodily sensations, approaches and outcomes vary. Coaching, therapy and mindfulness practices can aid in understanding and modifying interoception.”</p>
<p>She continues: “It’s also worth noting that those of us with neurodivergent differences such as <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/adhd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADHD</a>, autism or sensory processing differences often exhibit variability in interoceptive awareness.”</p>
<p>For most of us, tuning into our emotions and prioritising self-care can help to improve our awareness. </p>
<h3>1. Make time for some self-care</h3>
<p>“<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/mindfulness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mindfulness</a> or meditation practices allow us to direct our attention inwards,” says Kaur. “When we’re focused on our bodies we become more aware of what is going on inside it. Breathwork is a great way of reconnecting to our bodies and increasing relaxation.”</p>
<h3>2. Physical activity</h3>
<p>“Any kind of movement, especially activities that engage body awareness such as dancing, certain sports, yoga or tai chi can help us to foster a stronger connection between physical movement and internal bodily sensations,” says Kaur, and all of which can benefit our interoceptive awareness. </p>
<p>If you’re concerned about interoception or any aspect of your health, it’s always best to seek professional support. </p>

<p>Toast is a fail-safe go-to after a night out, and you can up its nutritional value by choosing toppings packed with protein, vitamins and minerals. And while it might not entirely cancel out a night of drinking, at lease you’ll have replenished some goodness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This is a filling, nutritious snack containing lots of fibre and healthy fats,” says Dr Cooke. “The hummus will keep blood sugars stable while the tomatoes will give you a vitamin hit, as they’re packed full of vitamin C and B.</p>
<p>“Pumpkin seeds contain magnesium, zinc and are a source of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/food/improve-sleep-recover-quicker-easy-recipes/552899" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tryptophan,</a> which all help you to get a good night’s sleep.” Essential after a night on the town!&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Ingredients&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>2 slices wholegrain toast&nbsp;</p>
<p>Handful sliced cherry tomatoes</p>
<p>2 tablespoons hummus</p>
<p>1 tablespoon toasted pumpkin seeds&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Toast your bread,&nbsp;then generously slather hummus on top.</li>

<p>Less a recipe, more a grab-and-go idea, snacks don’t get simpler than edamame. If you’re feeling adventurous, you can top them with chilli flakes rather than (or as well as) salt, but these beauties are delicious just as they are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Edamame beans are so convenient - they can be bought frozen and microwaved when needed within a few minutes,” says Dr Cooke. “Top them with sea salt for a delicious plant-based snack full of fibre and protein to help fill you up. They are low in saturated fat and won’t spike your blood sugars, making them a great alternative to higher salt and fat options.”</p>
<p><b>Ingredients&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>250g edamame beans (in pods or ready podded)</p>
<p>Pinch of coarse-ground sea salt</p>
<p><b>Method</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Pop the beans in a bowl and sprinkle on the salt.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Toss to combine.&nbsp;</li>

<p>This snack is a winner on all fronts - not only is it nutrient-dense and delicious, but you can prepare it all before you go out, and leave the flavours to soak in as you’re out revelling. All you need to do is grab a spoon and dig in! </p>
<p>“This snack is great if you’re wanting something sweet,” says Dr Cooke.  “It’s full of protein and complex carbohydrates (from the oats) to help keep you full, as well as healthy fats from the tahini. Oats also contain melatonin which can help you <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/nutrition-sleep-better-reduce-inflammation-tryptophan-foods/552266" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sleep</a> better.”</p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<p>200g plain yoghurt or plant-based alternative</p>
<p>Handful of fresh or frozen berries </p>
<p>50g oats (try them toasted for added crunch and texture) </p>
<p>Drizzle of maple syrup </p>
<p>Drizzle of tahini</p>
<p><b>Method</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Layer a medium-sized bowl with the yoghurt. </li>
<li>Top with your choice of fruits and oats (nuts would work, too). </li>
<li>Drizzle with maple syrup and tahini and tuck in. Enjoy!</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you thought that <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/misogyny" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#girlmaths</a> was an unhelpful and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/sexism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">misogynistic</a> trend, you’ll be disappointed to hear that it’s spawned a whole range of unsavoury microtrends – and #winemaths is one you may have come across. </p>
<p>“If we’re both having a glass of wine we may as well just get a bottle,” reads one caption on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drink.folc/video/7298771999889935649?q=%23winemaths&t=1700054419482" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a>, while others more explicitly reference it enabling their drinking habits. #winemaths is characterised by using dubious rounding-up to encourage us to drink more wine – and it appears to be working. </p>
<p>With new research showing that British women are the biggest <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/alcohol-binge-drinking-types-personality-study/331828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">binge-drinkers</a> in the developed world, what seems like an innocuous and amusing way of rationalising our alcohol consumption suddenly seems a lot more sinister. A report by the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/health/health-at-a-glance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> (OECD) compared alcohol consumption across 38 member countries - and the UK topped the global charts for binge-drinking among women. </p>
<p>We take a look at what really happens to our bodies and minds when we go down the “we may as well just get a bottle” train of thought – and why binge-drinking is less glamorous and more downright dangerous. 
	  </p>
<h2><\h2><p>“Binge-drinking is all about drinking to excess, but not all of the time,” explains counsellor <a href="https://www.georginasturmer.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgina Sturmer</a>.  “A binge-drinker might drink moderately, or not at all, between binges.  We might assume that a binge would always be accompanied by a big night out or a social event.  But that assumption doesn’t always ring true.  Many binge-drinkers will drink to excess quietly and on their own, in the privacy of their own home.”</p>
<p>Worryingly, the #winemaths trend makes drinking more than we usually would seem alluring, and while you might not consider yourself a binge-drinker, if you’re abstaining all week before a weekend bender (whatever this may look like to you), the bad news is that this is classed as heavy episodic drinking – aka binge-drinking. </p>
<p>And at this time of year, with <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/christmas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas parties</a> and gatherings pretty much every week, this can soon add up to a lot of alcohol. While a “if we’re all doing it, it doesn’t count” mindset is appealing, tapping into our pack mentality – it’s simply not true. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>While there’s no research suggesting an amount of alcohol that actually benefits us, there is some anecdotal evidence that drinking small amounts regularly is much better for us than going all-out every now and then - take the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/longevity-lessons-from-blue-zones/818397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Zones</a>, where drinking a little is part of the culture. </p>
<p>But the experts all agree that drinking to excess is bad, both mentally and physically. </p>
<p>“Alcohol is linked to various cancers and around 200 other diseases,” says sober coach <a href="https://annasudburysober.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Sudbury</a>. “Binge-drinking increases these risks, but there are multiple other ways alcohol can cause damage.”</p>
<h3>Physical impact of binge-drinking </h3>
<p><b>Raised blood sugar</b></p>
<p>“Even one night of binging alcohol messes with your blood sugars and glucose levels - that’s why you are so hungry the next day,” explains Sudbury. “It raises both your cholesterol and your blood pressure, as well as your stress hormones - adrenaline and cortisol. Both of these are released in times of high stress and stop your body functioning efficiently and effectively.”</p>
<p><b>Disrupted digestion</b></p>
<p>Alcohol stops your gut from digesting food efficiently – you might notice a ‘booze bloat’ or a funny tummy. </p>
<p>“Gut health is also linked to your mental health, so the ‘booze blues’ or ‘beer fear’ might hit the next day,” warns Sudbury. </p>
<p><b>Sluggish liver function</b></p>
<p>Drinking alcohol also prevents your organs (in particular your liver, kidneys and heart) from working as well as they should – your liver alone has 500 vital functions and can’t function at its best when it’s also dealing with alcohol in the body.</p>
<p><b>Poor sleep</b></p>
<p>And last but not least, while you might crash out easily after a night of drinking, you won’t be getting quality sleep. “Alcohol stops you achieving REM sleep, affecting memory consolidation, brain development and emotional processing,” says Sudbury.</p>

</section>
<h3>Mental effects of binge-drinking </h3>
<p>And unfortunately, the negative impacts of binge-drinking aren’t limited to physical effects – if you’ve ever struggled with <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/festive-hangover-anxiety-christmas-party-season/735558" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hangxiety</a>, you’ll know exactly what we mean. </p>
<p><b>It can heighten difficult emotions</b></p>
<p>“Binge-drinking is often, in some way, a coping strategy,” explains Sturmer. “But the key element to remember is that the act of binge-drinking is unlikely to make handling life’s difficulties easier. Perhaps we are feeling anxious, depressed, scared or worried, and we turn to binge-drinking to make these feelings go away.  The reality is that these feelings remain, and fester, and are likely to worsen.”</p>
<p class=""><b>It impacts our relationships</b></p>
<p>By its very nature, binge-drinking is something that is generally out of the ordinary for us.  This means that it can make us act and respond in ways that seem out of character or unpredictable. </p>
<p>“Acting differently when drinking can have a negative impact on our relationships with those around us” says Sturmer. “They might struggle to cope with how we present ourselves when we have been drinking.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>If you recognise that you’re falling into binge-drinking habits and behaviours, all is not lost. </p>
<p>“The first step is to recognise that our drinking is causing a problem,” cautions Sturmer. ” Notice if you’re turning to binge-drinking as a way of coping with life’s difficulties – then it’s a two-pronged attack. Firstly, try to figure out what you need in order to curtail your drinking.  It might mean abstinence, or a support programme, or it might mean setting limits and sticking to them. </p>
<p>“The other half of the coin is to figure out what lies beneath the binges, however infrequent they are. What are you trying to cope with, or forget, or ignore? “</p>
<p>If you’re struggling to face up to your fears or worries, or think that your drinking patterns are becoming problematic, seek professional support. And we don’t mean from TikTok. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After your everything-shower, do you find your hair’s clogging the plug hole? Do strands coat your hairbrush? Or maybe you just feel like you’re living with perma-split ends no matter what you do.</p>
<p>Whether you’re curly or coily, have fine or thick tresses, we’re taught from a young age that our locks should be luscious, stat… but the reality is that hair fall (that’s breakage from the roots, mid-lengths or ends of your hair) is very normal, very common and can happen to anyone at any life stage.</p>
<p>As many as seven out of 10 women will experience hair fall, so if this is you, you’re not alone. We’ve spoken to the experts to uncover the reasons why you might be experiencing an increase in hair fall due to breakage and how you can treat your locks with the care they deserve… </p>

<img class="pp-media__image" alt="placeholder" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2022/12/01165500/placeholder-1-e1533569576673-960x960-300x300-1-300x300.png">

<h4 class="listicle__title">1. Your daily routine</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>Probably not the best news, but, essentially, in whatever way you look after your locks, your daily routine is likely causing some damage to your hair by default. </p>
<p>However, the good news is that you can make some small tweaks to your routine to support your scalp and reduce hair fall.</p>
<p>“Tying ponytails or buns too frequently or too tightly, including while sleeping, will cause excessive hair fall and a line of breakage further up the head at the point where hair’s tied back,” says Sarah Bedford, stylist at the sustainable <a href="https://bluetitlondon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Tit Salon</a>. </p>
<p>“When it comes to brushing hair, this induces a certain level of tension, and if done incorrectly, this can lead to breakage,” says Gaia Tonanzi, founder of curly hair education platform, <a href="https://www.tootilab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tooti</a>. </p>
<p>“It has always been thought that all hair should be brushed when dry, since wet hair is at its weakest, but studies show this doesn’t actually apply to all hair types.</p>
<p>“Curly hair is actually best brushed while wet and with conditioner on it, because the water gently loosens up the curl pattern, and the conditioner helps the brush glide through with less tugging.”</p>
<p>The towels you’re using to dry your hair also could stimulate hair fall. </p>
<p>“Traditional terrycloth towels aren’t the best materials for being kind to your hair,” says Tonanzi. </p>
<p>“The rough, raised surface of the fabric can easily create friction, frizz and breakage. It’s best to swap to microfibre or jersey materials that are much smoother.”  </p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">placeholder</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 class="listicle__title">2. Pollution</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>It may feel like this one’s out of our hands, but founder of <a href="https://fowler35.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fowler35</a> and expert at <a href="https://www.kerastase.co.uk/ranges/regimen/genesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kérastase Paris</a> Darren Fowler says there are ways we can minimise how pollution impacts our tresses. </p>
<p>“Yes, pollution can lead to the accumulation of dirt and toxins on the scalp, potentially contributing to hair fall, but there are products on the market that can help give your hair a specific type of pollutant-removing TLC,” he tells <i>Stylist</i>. </p>
<p>“Kérastase’s <a href="https://www.kerastase.co.uk/ranges/regimen/genesis/genesis-serum-anti-chute-fortifiant/KER_00050.html?utm_source=crm&utm_medium=email_brand&utm_content=ker_haca_genesis_text_aw&utm_campaign=ker_haca_genesis_online-article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis Anti-Chute Fortifiant Hair Serum</a> is formulated to help reduce hair fall caused by external aggressors such as pollution. It fortifies the hair, helping to make it more resilient.”</p>
</div>
<figure class="pp-media pp-media--pull-centre listicle__image">
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="placeholder" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2022/12/01165500/placeholder-1-e1533569576673-960x960-300x300-1-300x300.png">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">placeholder</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 class="listicle__title">3. Stress</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>It’s probably no surprise that stress can cause an increase in hair fall – the spike in cortisol can affect our bodies’ entire ecosystems. </p>
<p>There’s a vicious circle at play here because while stress may be causing your hair fall, an increase in hair fall is likely to stress you out further – but we’ve spoken to the experts to help you stop that panic cycle in its tracks. </p>
<p>“You may not think you’re stressed or anxious until your body tells you,” says Declan Howarth, colour director at <a href="https://bluetitlondon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Tit Salon</a>. </p>
<p>“When our bodies go through stress, vital organs are prioritised in that fight or flight moment, and so the blood goes to those organs rather than to our hair or skin, which is why you may experience an increase in hair fall or a break-out.” </p>
<p>“This has a knock-on effect for our strands, as our scalp isn’t receiving as much oxygenated blood as normal – but if this happens, know that your body will level out and normalise again once your stress levels come down. </p>
<p>“Hair fall as a result of stress is a shifting of hair cycles, not a permanent change.”</p>
</div>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">placeholder</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 class="listicle__title">4. Heat styling</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>Savvy hair girlies are opting for heatless curls for a reason – heat styling can weaken locks and lead to hair fall due to breakage. </p>
<p>“A top tip to reduce damage is to dry most of your hair with a hair dryer before using a brush and then, on a lower heat, take big sections with a round brush to minimise direct heat contact on the hair,” says <a href="https://www.timothydavid.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timothy David</a>, celeb hairstylist to the likes of <i>Sex Education</i>’s Gillian Anderson. </p>
<p>Before using heat on your hair, spritzing it with the right product will make the world of difference. </p>
<p>“I always recommend Kérastase’s <a href="https://www.kerastase.co.uk/ranges/regimen/genesis/genesis-defense-thermique/KER_00048.html?utm_source=crm&utm_medium=email_brand&utm_content=ker_haca_genesis_text_aw&utm_campaign=ker_haca_genesis_online-article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis Defense Thermique Blow Dry Primer</a> as a heat protectant – it helps to shield hair up to 220 degrees* from thermal damage, helping to reduce hair fall due to breakage,” says Fowler. </p>
</div>
<figure class="pp-media pp-media--pull-centre listicle__image">
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="placeholder" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2022/12/01165500/placeholder-1-e1533569576673-960x960-300x300-1-300x300.png">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">placeholder</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 class="listicle__title">5. Lack of maintenance</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>If you’re trying to grow your hair longer, it might seem a little counter-intuitive to get a haircut, but not cutting your hair enough can actually lead to an increase in hair fall.</p>
<p>“Getting your hair cut when you’re looking to grow it is actually the best way to achieve your goal,” says Tonanzi. </p>
<p>“Going for regular trims at the hairdresser will help remove the ends before they become too compromised, and the hair will grow longer in return. </p>
<p>“Every three to four months is a good timeline if your hair isn’t particularly processed, but if you dye it or use heat tools frequently you might want to go more often than that.”</p>
</div>
<figure class="pp-media pp-media--pull-centre listicle__image">
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="placeholder" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2022/12/01165500/placeholder-1-e1533569576673-960x960-300x300-1-300x300.png">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">placeholder</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 class="listicle__title">6. Chemical damage</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>“When it comes to colouring your hair, chemicals can obviously start to cause damage. To recorrect this I always recommend using  the <a href="https://www.kerastase.co.uk/ranges/regimen/genesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kérastase Genesis range</a>,” says David.</p>
<p>“The range helps with fallout from the roots and looks after hair that has withstood too much chemical aggression. Using the right products between professional colour appointments really helps.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twenty years ago today, the face of the British romantic comedy was changed forever. Richard Curtis’s <i>Love Actually</i> was an instant hit that has gone on to become a cult classic and a Christmas staple for many. One of the first true ensemble <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/film/christmas-romcom-single-dead-dead-wife-trope/739606" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">romcoms</a>, it paved the way for other holiday-themed projects like 2010’s <i>Valentine’s Day </i>and 2011’s <i>New Year’s Eve. </i></p>
<p>There isn’t really an overarching plot in <i>Love Actually</i>. Instead, we follow a series of loosely connected couples as they gear up for Christmas. There’s David (Hugh Grant), the bumbling new prime minister who falls for his assistant, the charming and chatty Natalie (Martine McCutcheon). Then there’s Jamie (Colin Firth), the glum and newly single writer who strikes up a romance with his Portuguese maid, Aurelia (Lúcia Moniz), even though she doesn’t speak a word of English. There’s also Daniel (Liam Neeson), a grieving widow taking care of his stepson, Sam (a young Thomas Brodie-Sangster). Then, there is the lovely Karen (Emma Thompson), who after discovering her husband, Harry (Alan Rickman), is having an affair, allows herself to have one quiet breakdown upstairs before painting on a smile for the kids. And, crucially, there are also lots and lots of turtlenecks and one utterly iconic octopus costume.</p>
<p>Looking back at it now, <i><a href="%E2%80%93" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Love Actually</a> </i>is certainly a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/romantic-comedy-love-actually-youve-got-mail-you-netflix-stalking-manipulation-mania/246394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">product of its time</a>. There are several horrifying jokes about weight and Curtis doesn’t offer a particularly diverse portrait of London. Nevertheless, it remains a nostalgic, festive reminder that maybe for a while we can all pretend that love <i>is</i> all around, actually. With its impeccable cast, it’s also a very satisfying who’s who of British cinema in the 00s.</p>
<p>If, like us, you find yourself switching on <i>Love Actually </i>once a year, you may find yourself wondering: where might these characters be today, two decades later? Well, here’s what we imagine.</p>
<h3><b>The prime minister and Natalie </b></h3>

</figure>
<p>After standing up for the UK in a rousing, if simplistic, speech aimed at the bullying American president, David continued his term as PM with a bit more gumption and confidence. However, his new girlfriend, Natalie, made things complicated; it was 2003, after all, so she quickly became a frequent face on the front pages of the tabloids. It wasn’t a great time for young women in the public eye, and soon, Natalie found everything too difficult. They broke up. </p>
<p>However, as they live in a Richard Curtis romcom, David realised he couldn’t live without her and decided not to run for another term. The pair opted to live somewhere in Europe and have a documentary coming out on Netflix next year about their experiences with the press. Oh, and Annie, David’s fatphobic chief of staff, was fired.</p>
<h3><b>Jamie and Aurelia</b></h3>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>

</figure>
<p>We are happy to say that Jamie and Aurelia are now a happily married couple living in rural Portugal – after all, Jamie wasn’t a huge fan of the city. He still writes on his ancient typewriter, while Aurelia runs a local restaurant. In their spare time, they’ve taken up wild swimming. While Jamie begrudgingly sees his own huge family from time to time (including his awful brother), he has grown to love his expressive in-laws and prefers to spend the holidays with them.</p>
<h3><b>Karen and Harry</b></h3>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="love actually karen emma thompson by christmas tree" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/16172844/la_l02417_rgb-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Universal Pictures</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After sticking with her awful husband for a few more years for the sake of their children, Karen finally divorced Harry about 12 years ago. Since then, she has been living her best life, travelling with friends, getting back to work and even dating a little. </p>
<p>Harry is sad and depressed and alone. He is starting to see the appeal of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/joni-mitchell-guardian-interview-what-is-love/442003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joni Mitchell</a>, but unfortunately, it is too little too late. </p>
<h3><b>Juliet and Peter (and Mark)</b></h3>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="love actually juliet and peter at their wedding" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/16172823/la_l00829_rgb-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">universal pictures</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are still together, although, after marrying young, they have had their ups and downs. They have two teenage kids and one doodle mix dog and live either in Islington or East Dulwich. </p>
<p>As for Mark (Andrew Lincoln), things got a bit weird between him and his bestie after Peter found out about the stalker-ish wedding video and the creepy “say it’s carol singers” business. However, over time, it has become something of a standing joke and all three are now good friends. </p>
<h3><b>Judy and John</b></h3>
<p>These two got married six months after meeting on set and now live in a cute Hobbit-like cottage outside of London. Judy (Joanna Page) landed a few roles in British TV shows and she now teaches drama to kids. As for John (Martin Freeman), he ended up working in film production. They had several kids and lived happily ever after.</p>
<h3><b>Sarah and Karl</b></h3>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="karl in love actually" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2017/10/24194700/1e958d9ff09e57685b32b2daeba9b16c-652x652.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Universal Pictures</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/love-actually-cast-sarah-karl-relationship-laura-linney-rodrigo-santoro/335419" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah (Laura Linney) and Karl (Rodrigo Santoro)</a> sadly never went on a date or really spoke to each other again, even though Sarah had been in love with him for “two years, seven months, three days and I suppose an hour and thirty minutes”. Sarah left her job and found an office with a manager who didn’t pull her aside and tell her to ask out other employees. She eventually met a nice, understanding man who, though less ruggedly handsome, could comprehend that, yes, adults have complex families and responsibilities.</p>
<h3><b>Daniel and Sam</b></h3>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="love actually Sam and Daniel" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/16172906/la_l03554_rgb-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Universal Pictures</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Daniel dated the Claudia Schiffer look-a-like for a while, but soon realised he needed more time after his wife’s death. When Sam moved away for university, he hit a low point. But that’s when he suddenly began to see Karen, his best friend, in a whole new light. The pair are now in the midst of a late-in-life romance that honestly deserves its own film.</p>
<h3><b>Billy and Joe</b></h3>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="love actually bill nighy billy mack" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/16172927/la_l05094_rgb-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Universal Pictures</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These two are pretty much right where we left them. Billy (Bill Nighy) left music behind for good after his cover of <i>Love Is All Around</i> was a surprise hit. He and manager Joe (Gregor Fisher) spend most weekends on the sofa, beer in hand, reminiscing about the good old days. It is a bromance for the ages.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Staying well doesn’t have to be complicated: eat a balanced diet, drink plenty of water, exercise regularly and prioritise sleep and you’re certain to feel the benefits.</p>
<p>But beyond the basics, there are plenty of things we can do to give our wellbeing an extra boost, from stress-relieving techniques, such as breathwork and meditation, to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/biohacking-workshop-longevity-lessons/828300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">longevity-boosting treatments</a> and gut-friendly hacks. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most popular intervention is the practice of adding supplements and health foods into our diets; you only need to look at the hype surrounding ingredients such as <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/ashwagandha-supplement-anxiety-benefits-review/832764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ashwagandha</a> and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/seaweed-sea-moss-2023-food-trend/757624" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sea moss</a> over the last 12 months to see just how many of us are looking for new foods and nutrients to support our wellbeing.</p>
<p>And as we move into 2024, we can expect even more of these wellness-boosting ingredients to enjoy some time in the limelight. That’s according to <a href="https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holland & Barrett</a>, whose 2024 trends report identifies several key foods beginning to make a name for themselves in the wellness industry. Here are four of the ones you’ll be seeing everywhere next year. 
	  </p>
<h2><\h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Tremella" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/16162458/tremella-1080x1080.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you’ve found yourself on <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/tiktok-new-wellness-fitness-platform/395346" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wellness TikTok</a> at all over the last year, you’ll know that <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/medicinal-mushrooms-fitness-cordyceps/706026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mushrooms</a> have become big business. As we head into 2024, that interest is only set to keep growing.  </p>
<p>That’s thanks to a pair of mushrooms that have dominated Chinese medicine for centuries: turkey tail and tremella. While <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/smart-cocktails-hangover-free-party-season/740983" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lion’s mane and reishi</a> may have reigned supreme in 2023, Holland & Barrett predicts that these two mushrooms will be popping up everywhere next year. On TikTok, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/turkeytail?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the hashtag #TurkeyTail</a> has already reached 61.2 million views alone. </p>
<p>But what makes these mushrooms so special? Early <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3763079/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> suggests they could provide neurological benefits – something the experts predict we’ll all be paying more attention to over the next 12 months.  </p>
<p>Research into tremella has found it has the potential to be a neuroprotective agent, with <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20587384211000541#bibr64-20587384211000541" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a study in mice</a> suggesting the supplement could improve learning and memory ability. It’s also becoming an emerging ingredient in the beauty industry, with a 2014 study finding that the polysaccharides found within tremella <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8172338/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could reduce the effects of sun-induced ageing</a> on the skin.</p>
<p>When it comes to turkey tail, <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/turkey-tail-mushroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most of the research</a> has looked at its potential as an immune-supporting agent and gut health aid, but there have been a few studies that have looked into its impact on brain health, too. One clinical trial and several laboratory studies have found that the compounds within the mushroom have antioxidant properties, <a href="https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Turkey_Tail_Mushrooms.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">making them potentially neuroprotective</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, more research is needed to prove these benefits, but as research into mushrooms continues, you can expect to see more fungi-focused supplements and health foods hitting the shelves. </p>
<h2><\h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Zynamite mango leaf extract" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/16162131/zynamite-mango-leaf-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The sweet and tasty fruit aside, <a href="https://nektium.com/zynamite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emerging studies</a> have revealed that the mango tree could offer even more benefits. Mango leaf extract – of which a trademarked version has been made called Zynamite – is growing in popularity as a supplement due to <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/8/2194/htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">early research</a> which suggests it can support mental alertness, reaction time and even reduce fatigue.</p>
<p>The leaf can be brewed in tea or consumed in a supplement form, but as we move into 2024 we may see more companies incorporating the ingredient into their products.</p>
<p>Rachel Chatterton, head of food development at Holland & Barrett, says mango leaf extract is likely to grow in popularity as more of us look for natural ways to stay energised.</p>
<p>“Coffee is still the go-to for customers wanting to boost their energy levels, but we’ll increasingly see solutions which incorporate food and supplements to further enhance energy levels,” she explains.  </p>
<h2><\h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Haskap berries" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/16160934/haskpa-berries-pic-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Haskap berries have long been known for their antioxidant properties, but we can expect to see them reach the mainstream as we move into 2024.  </p>
<p>Celebrated in Japan as ‘the elixir of life’, these berries contain <a href="https://www.haskapa.com/pages/active-ingredient" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">up to four times more anthocyanins</a> – a type of antioxidant naturally found in foods – than blueberries. While haskap berries may look similar to blueberries on the outside, it’s inside where the difference is to be found; blueberries have a pale green interior, while the inside of a haskap berry is dark purple, which shows us it’s bursting with anthocyanin goodness.  </p>
<p>Those benefits aside, research into the potential of haskap berries for boosting sports performance is also exciting. Indeed, <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/4/780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one study</a> into the impact of haskap berry consumption in runners found that the berry could increase the amount of time runners could perform before reaching fatigue and lead to a 2% increase in running time performance.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6842388/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another study</a> found that the supplement could help to boost cognition and blood pressure in older adults – suggesting that the berry could have widespread potential within the health and wellness industry. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you thought you’d left your <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/ballet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ballet</a> days far behind you, you might want to think again. <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/barre-for-beginners-full-body-workout/568745" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barre</a> classes are becoming hugely popular right now, and they’re a fantastic <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/best-full-body-strength-training-workouts/418140" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full-body</a>, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/low-impact-cardio-best-workout-benefits/410807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">low-impact</a> way to improve <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/strength-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strength</a>, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/flexibility-change-get-older/536703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flexibility</a> and even reduce our stress levels. It’s easy on the joints, and you don’t need any equipment, so it’s super accessible. </p>
<p>You don’t need to channel your inner prima ballerina to do it – trust us when we say we have zero dance capabilities – and it’s relatively easy to take part from home or at a class,  but know that it will push your body to its absolute limit every time, so get ready to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/muscle-pain-vs-injury/556211" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feel the burn</a>. </p>
<p>Here are the top five benefits of a barre workout – and while many forms of movement have similar merits, you’d struggle to achieve all of these (in one hit) elsewhere. 
	  </p>
<h2><\h2><h3>1. Improved posture and alignment<br />
	  </h3>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="woman in second postion plie - benefits of barre" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/16142344/barre-benefits-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s face it, most of us could do with some work on our <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/how-to-improve-bad-posture/249678" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posture</a>, and barre is the perfect way to draw attention to this – you need only think of a ballerina’s grace and poise to see what we mean. </p>
<p>“The focus on proper body alignment in barre exercises contributes to improved posture,” explains Catie Miller, barre expert and founder of <a href="https://barreseries.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barre Series</a>. “Learning correct alignment can help to alleviate muscle imbalances, reduce joint stress and promote better body mechanics overall.”</p>
<p>So, if you’re constantly picking up injuries with other forms of training, try adding a barre class to your regimen and notice the difference.</p>
<p>Barre is great for <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/strength-training-fundamental-moves/507069" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">functional movement</a> too – you might notice, in time, that it feels easier to carry your shopping home or to bend over and pick things up from the floor. Barre improves your functional movement – those little, everyday actions that can decline as we age. 
	  </p>
<h3>2. Enhanced flexibility</h3>
<p>If you think you’re <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/improve-flexibility-stretches-touch-toes/585625" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flexible</a> now, just wait till you’ve practised barre for a while.</p>
<p>“Barre incorporates many stretches that help improve flexibility and range of motion,” says Miller.  “Enhanced flexibility leads to better joint health but also aids in injury prevention and promotes graceful movements.”</p>
<p>If you’re after an even deeper stretch, try adding a lateral band into your movement. For example, you could deepen a second position plie with a lateral stretch by holding a band between your palms. You’ll be able to safely extend your range of motion, and if you tap into some controlled breathing too, you might never do a standard stretch again. </p>
<h3>3. Improved core strength</h3>
<p>Much like ballet, yoga and pilates, barre workouts place a heavy emphasis on core engagement, which, over time, will result in a stronger and more stable core – without a crunch in sight. </p>
<p>“A strong core supports proper posture, reduces the risk of back pain and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6110226/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enhances overall athletic performance</a>,” says Miller. And <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6110226/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies</a> show that core exercises can benefit spinal stability, balance and help prevent injury. </p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>4. Improved mental health and stress relief </h3>
<p>We know that any form of movement is great for our <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mental health</a>, but barre in particular boosts our mood and acts as a great stress reliever. </p>
<p>“One of the biggest benefits of barre is the fact that it is (counterintuitive as it might seem) super relaxing,” says Miller. “Barre workouts encourage mindfulness and body awareness. The rhythmic movements, precise technique and focus on breath create a meditative experience unlike many other forms of exercise, reducing stress and promoting mental wellbeing.”</p>
<p>Just try to hold a first position plie with both heels raised and tell us you’re still thinking about work/life/any kind of stress – we guarantee all you’ll be focusing on is how hard it is and when you can stop. 
	  </p>
<h3>5. Sharpened cognitive skills </h3>
<p>In addition to its relaxing nature, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/ballet-and-barre-workouts-can-help-you-to-think-clearer-these-are-the-classes-to-try-for-better-mental-clarity/782793" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">barre is amazing for keeping our grey matter ticking over</a> – again, vital as we age. </p>
<p>“Barre is fantastic for promoting better thinking and learning abilities,” says Miller. “Because it involves complex mental coordination, such as synchronising music and movement, it activates the brain’s reward centres and sensory-motor circuits in a unique way that’s so beneficial for our minds.”</p>
<p>So, if you fancy shaking up your exercise regime, you can’t go far wrong with incorporating a barre class. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s my penultimate day at an Italian sleep retreat, and I’m in what I can only describe as an out-of-body trance as my second session with a ‘<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/trauma-on-the-internet-am-i-traumatised/818872" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trauma</a>-healer’ comes to an end. I’m lying on a waterbed overlooking one of the pretty outdoor pools and mist-swathed hills in the distance, and my body feels noticeably different – almost like my inner organs are gently vibrating.</p>
<p>This is just one small part of the six-day sleep retreat I’m on at <a href="https://www.preidlhof.it/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preidlhof</a>, a sprawling, adults-only hotel that sits on the sun-dappled slopes that frame the picturesque Alpine town of Merano in the Italian Dolomites. </p>
<p>Sleep and I have long been incompatible bedfellows, and despite my best efforts, nothing I’ve tried seems to work. After years of chasing a solid eight-hour kip, I’m unconvinced that a week-long stint in a (albeit multi-award winning) bougie hotel will offer any sort of long-lasting remedy. </p>
<p>Requiring a minimum stay of five nights to allow guests to reap the full benefits, Preidlhof’s program incorporates trauma-healing and transformational wellness to release emotional blocks, anxiety and tension. Resident experts also use refined bodywork techniques to reconnect and ‘harmonise’ the mind and body.</p>
<p>I spend the week drifting from one treatment to the next, making use of the various swimming pools and sunbathing fascilities. There’s also a six-storey sauna tower in which, it should be noted, guests are expected to sweat <i>sans</i> clothes (a surprisingly liberating experience).</p>
<p>As for the regime, there’s <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/sleep/how-to-sleep-yoga-stretches-insomnia/344997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sleep yoga</a> (which is as relaxing as it sounds), and massages that take place on a bed of heated rose quartz (thought by <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/crystals-wellness-beauty-fashion-rose-quartz/190609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crystal believers</a> to boost feelings of peace and calm and support emotional healing). But the most remarkable treatment is the aforementioned session with world-renowned trauma-healer Stefano Battaglia.</p>

<p>I’m bemused when I find out I’ll be seeing a trauma-healer as part of the program. What’s <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/how-to-cope-without-access-to-therapy/514000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trauma</a> got to do with sleep, I wonder? What trauma did I have to release? Battaglia explains that to treat restlessness, it’s important to first address the cause of it, and asks whether there’s something going on that might be the source of my unease. I tell him about the seven years I’ve spent navigating the bureaucratic visa system for the right to remain in Australia. After listening to my woes, we start the session, during which he treats me with a combination of mindfulness and trauma touch techniques.</p>
<p>It’s never occurred to me before that my problems with sleep might go beyond genetics or a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/second-screening-phone-addiction-impact/829519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mild addiction to my phone</a> – but it makes perfect sense.  What I need to give up, he tells me, is the tension I’ve been living with of late (easier said than done). The very nature of life is its uncertainty, he reminds me – regardless of where in the world we’re living.</p>

<p> Sleep comes easily that night. But drifting off in the Dolomites is one thing and maintaining a solid sleep routine back at home is quite another.</p>
<p>Loads of us struggle with our sleep. In fact, <a href="https://www.aviva.com/newsroom/news-releases/2017/10/Sleepless-cities-revealed-as-one-in-three-adults-suffer-from-insomnia/#:~:text=Two%20thirds%20(67%25)%20of,%25)%20worst%20affected%20by%20insomnia." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent research</a> by Aviva found that two thirds (67%) of UK adults suffer from disrupted sleep, while a recent survey carried out by <a href="https://thesleepcharity.org.uk/sleeptember-knowyoursleep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sleep Charity</a> found that 43% of those who struggle to fall asleep cite stress as the main cause. </p>
</p>
<p>That won’t come as a surprise to anyone. If anything, it’s amazing that that stress figure isn’t higher – especially when you factor in things like the cost of living crisis, war and our soaring use of screens. It can take years to master the art of drifting off to sleep, and it goes without saying that there’s only so much a pack of expensive bath salts, a weighted blanket or a five star resort can do. </p>

<p>When I talk to Patrizia Bortolin, Preidlhof’s spa director, she tells me that “a desire to sleep better is one of the most common requests we hear from guests” and that the program’s trauma healing sessions “are key to addressing what keeps our guests awake”.</p>
</p>
<p>She recommends integrating regular meditation sessions into my evening routine, and is also an advocate for having a self-imposed digital detox. In fact, the hotel now offers guests the option of trading in their phone for a digital detox kit on check-in.</p>

<p>So, back home, how has the retreat improved my sleep? The biggest change has come from <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/journaling-technique-emotional-wellbeing/551782" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">journalling before bed</a>. I’ve found that doing a pre-lights out <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/one-good-thing-brain-dump-before-bed/830305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brain dump</a> has stopped the anxieties I discussed with Battaglia from affecting my sleep. It’s nothing new or wacky, but it’s a practice that wellness expert Marie Reynolds also recommends. </p>
<p>“Get into the habit of journaling about the specific things that are bothering you every night before bed,” she tells <i>Strong Women</i>. “Then assess whether it’s something you’re in control of. If the answer is ‘yes’, then write down the logical steps you can take to remedy the situation.” </p>
</p>
<p>Going on a week-long sleep retreat was dreamy and the skills I picked up have definitely made a difference to the quality of my slumber, but these tools aren’t unique to Preidlhof. Fundamentally, the retreat confirms the importance of simple but effective interventions – and the role that stress and anxiety management can play in better sleep. Journalling has been overwhelmingly positive for me, but you might find that getting professional support in the form of a therapist, pre-bed yin yoga or plotting in phone-free weekends.  </p>
</p>
<p>As ever, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to insomnia, but I’ve found that far from the snowy mountains of Italy, address stress can be the first – and most important – step to sleeping soundly. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Content note: this article contains references to suicide that readers may find upsetting.</b></p>
<p>Imagine living in a world where your emotions are so intense and unpredictable that you feel like you are on a rollercoaster that never stops. Where your relationships feel constantly unstable and chaotic because you fear being abandoned or rejected by everyone you care about. Your sense of self is fragile and distorted and you often don’t know who you are or what you want.</p>
<p>This is what it’s like to have <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/borderline-personality-disorder-felt-unlovable/803219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">borderline personality disorder (BPD)</a>, also known as emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD). </p>
<p>BPD is a complex and often misunderstood mental health condition that affects how people perceive themselves and others, leading to difficulties in their work, relationships and emotions. It is not an especially rare disorder; The National Library of Medicine estimates that about 1.6% of US adults have BPD. That means more than 5 million Americans are living with the condition, and there are millions more around the world. However, over 40% of people with BPD do not get the correct diagnosis or treatment because their symptoms are often confused with other disorders.</p>
<p>I was one of these people. </p>

<h4>BPD doesn’t define me, but it is a part of me</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>I didn’t always know I had BPD. I started experiencing the symptoms when I was still in primary school. I remember feeling sad and lonely for no reason and having trouble connecting with my friends because, no matter what, I always felt like I didn’t quite belong. I remember constantly contending with the voice in my head telling me to hurt myself or biting my nails until they bled. Many nights ended with nightmares and flashbacks of traumatic events from my childhood until I was going days at a time without sleep and finding anything and everything I could to keep myself distracted. </p>
<p>I was barely 12, but I was already consumed with never-ending thoughts of how life was not worth living and wishing I could disappear. By the time I was 16, I’d tried to kill myself for the second time. It was then that I became obsessed with finding out what was wrong with me. </p>

</figure>
<p>At 17, I dropped maths and physics from my A-level subjects and started learning psychology. There wasn’t a teacher at my school for the subject, so I headed to the University of Zimbabwe to find one who could help me finally learn what exactly was wrong with me. For years, I had suffered from intense mood swings, impulsive behaviours, self-harm, suicidal thoughts and a chronic fear of abandonment. I felt like I had no identity or sense of self, and I constantly tried to fill the emptiness inside me with unhealthy coping mechanisms. I felt alone, hopeless and exhausted from the daily rollercoaster ride that I was desperate to get off. It felt like studying psychology would be the magic fix: I could finally learn what was wrong with me and I could be cured. I could finally end the nightmares and the crippling anxiety that came with surviving on a day-to-day basis. </p>
<p>One day, as I was studying, I came across a paragraph on BPD and it was like something clicked. I spent the next few days searching everything that I could about the disorder and it felt like I was finally understood. I cheered, celebrated and told everyone that I had found the answer. It wasn’t my fault; I just needed healing.</p>
<p>It would take two more years, another suicide attempt and a misdiagnosis to officially be diagnosed with BPD. This time around I was less ecstatic: although the doctors were finally confirming something I had suspected for years, I now knew that a diagnosis didn’t mean that I was healed. It didn’t mean that everything suddenly made sense and I could finally be happy. All it meant was that I had to face a new reality: something was wrong and it was something I had no control over. It was up to me to learn to accept myself, to cope with my symptoms, to deal with the stigma and, ultimately, to find hope. </p>

<p>Living with BPD is difficult. Every day, I still struggle with intense mood swings, periods of depression and anxiety, suicidal thoughts, thoughts of self-harm, impulsive behaviours and a chronic fear of abandonment. These things didn’t leave just because I had a diagnosis. </p>
<p>Getting a diagnosis was not the end of my journey or the grand solution I thought that it would be; instead, it was just the beginning. The BPD label came with its own set of challenges and struggles. </p>
<p>While being diagnosed helped me understand myself better and access the support and resources that I needed, it also triggered feelings of shame, guilt, anger and denial. Sometimes, I felt like I was broken or flawed, and that I deserved to be punished or rejected because my mental health condition meant that I was difficult to love.</p>
<p>Getting a diagnosis of BPD also affected my relationships with my family, friends and partners. Some of them were supportive and understanding, and they helped me to cope and heal. But some were not. For some, mental health was a white luxury that had no room in the lives of Africans struggling with basics like water, food and electricity. This was all before adding all the stigma and misconceptions that surround BPD, especially with the thousands of loud voices online that dictate what it means to be borderline. </p>
<p>Getting the diagnosis empowered me to take charge of my own recovery and find the best treatment options for me. But it also made me feel dependent on medication or therapy. It was difficult to balance the need for treatment and the need for independence, and to find the right combination of medication and therapy that worked for me.</p>
<p>Ultimately, getting a diagnosis inspired me to find meaning and purpose in my life and pursue my goals and passions. But it also made me feel hopeless or helpless about my future. Now that I had a word for all the bad thoughts that existed in my head, I also had to contend with a future where I may never be completely free of the pain. Sadly‌, while there could be understanding, there was no cure or quick fix. No simple or straightforward solution, just a complex process. </p>
<p>My diagnosis was the best and the worst thing that ever happened to me. I wouldn’t have it any other way because having BPD doesn’t define me, but it is a part of me. </p>
<p>I have learned to love myself, all of myself, even the parts that hurt.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gout is a condition you normally read about in history books and Dickensian literature. Henry VIII suffered from it, as did Alexander the Great. Heck, there was even a member of the murderous Medici family known as ‘Piero The Gouty’.</p>
<p>But in 2023, gout is on the rise and it’s not just game-chomping, claret-swilling monarchs who are at risk.</p></p>
<h2><\h2><p>Gout is a type of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/arthritis-causes-prevention/785656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arthritis</a> that occurs when high levels of uric acid build up in your blood, which can lead to needle-shaped crystals – called tophi – forming in and around the joints, causing pain and inflammation. Uric acid is created when chemical compounds called purines – which are naturally produced by the body but also found in certain foods – break down. Normal levels of uric acid are processed by the kidneys and passed out in urine, but when there’s too much, it backs up in the blood.
	  </p>
<p>The condition usually occurs in men over the age of 30 (with risk increasing with age), although post-<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/prepare-menopause-30s/695568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">menopausal women</a> are also susceptible. However, it’s been affecting an increasing number of young people in recent years. <a href="https://rmdopen.bmj.com/content/9/2/e003025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research</a> shows that between 1990 and 2019, there was a substantial global increase in the number of people aged 15 to 39 being diagnosed, rising from 38.71 cases per 100,000 people to 45.94. Although diagnoses were 80% more likely in young men, there was still a global increase in young women being diagnosed with the condition.</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Cartoon of gout" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/10/20105742/gettyimages-1288026707-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In fact, according to <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/supplementary-information/2022/hospital-admissions-for-gout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS data</a>, there was a 108% increase in women under the age of 39 being hospitalised for gout between 2015 and 2020, compared to a 50% increase in men of the same age bracket. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>“Symptoms of gout include a painful joint, which may develop quite rapidly; it most commonly affects your big toe, although other joints can be affected,” explains Dr Dave Nichols, resident NHS GP at <a href="https://myhealthchecked.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MyHealthChecked</a>.  </p>
</p>
<p>“There can also be swelling, warmth or redness over a joint and reduced movement. This tends to develop rapidly over a number of hours, and will gradually improve over a few days or weeks.” </p>
</p>
<p>A GP might perform blood tests to check uric acid levels, or they may take a sample of synovial fluid. Treatment can involve anti-inflammatory drugs and medication that helps lower levels of urate in the body. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>While many of us curse our monthly bleed, it’s thanks to our period that gout is still uncommon in young women.</p>
<p>During our cycle, we release oestrogen, and that hormone increases the removal of uric acid by the kidneys, explains Hazel Hayden, women’s health specialist and nurse consultant at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-independent-health-and-wellbeing-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Independent Health and Wellbeing Group</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>“Uric acid levels rise in women after the menopause, so the chance of getting gout increases. However, gout in younger women is often under-diagnosed as healthcare professionals don’t realise that they can still develop it.”</p>
<p>Laura was 38 when she contracted gout in 2021, but it wasn’t immediately diagnosed.</p>
<p>“I was at work and had sudden, severe pain in one of my big toes – it was so bad I could barely walk,” she recalls. “I went to my GP, who wasn’t very helpful. The pain wasn’t going away, so after doing some research, I went back and asked to be tested for gout. My doctor insisted it couldn’t be gout, so she was pretty surprised when it turned out that it was.” </p>
<h2><\h2><p>While young women are thought to be protected from gout by oestrogen, there are certain lifestyle factors that can contribute to contracting the disease.  </p>
</p>
<p>“Risk factors for gout include being overweight, drinking excessive amounts of alcohol (especially beer), having a diet which is high in purine-rich foods, including red meat or shellfish, and crash dieting,” advises Dr Nichols. </p>
</p>
<p>“Things that affect our kidney function – such as dehydration – or the use of certain medications, like diuretics can also contribute.</p>
<p>“Having kidney disease, diabetes, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/better-heart-health-tips/782524" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high blood pressure</a> or high cholesterol levels are also known to increase your risk. This may explain why younger women are now increasingly affected, as the age at which people are being diagnosed with these conditions is getting younger.” </p>
</p>
<p>While Laura’s doctor couldn’t be sure what caused her gout, she suspects it could have been brought on by her increased alcohol consumption over the Covid-19 lockdown. </p>
<p>Women who have had hysterectomies are also more likely to contract gout. </p>
</p>
<p>“This is due to the loss of oestrogen,” explains Hayden. “For some women, gout can also be cyclical as oestrogen levels go down in the lead-up to their period.” </p>
</p>
<p>Gout is known to be hereditary, with <a href="https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acr.25095" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one study</a> showing that you’re 95% more likely to get it if a parent or sibling has had it. However, <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-022-02341-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent research</a> shows that adopting a healthy lifestyle can reduce your risk of gout related to genetic factors by a third. </p>
</p>
<p>April, 32, was diagnosed with gout after experiencing severe pain in her foot, which she assumed was the start of bunions until a fellow gout sufferer suggested otherwise. “Our lifestyles are very different – I’m a vegan who rarely drinks – so I was shocked we were suffering from the same thing,” she tells Strong Women.  </p>

<p>“My treatment involved lots of water, ibuprofen and cherry juice – an expensive and surprisingly disgusting natural remedy that lowers uric acid. My mum suffers with gout, so when I was told it’s hereditary, it all made much more sense.”</p>
</p>
<p>While there’s no doubt that gout is affecting people at a younger age, most healthy pre-menopausal women can rest easy that it’s unlikely to be something they’ll suffer from. However, with modern lifestyles thought to be the cause of a rise in cases, it’s wise to be aware of the symptoms to minimise a delay in diagnosis should it ever occur. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know how your phone has that low power mode warning after hours of late-night <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/sleep/revenge-bedtime-procrastination-causes-effects/523932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doomscrolling</a>? Or the petrol gauge in your car will go from amber to red (at which point, if you’re anything like us, you’ll panic and scramble to the closest petrol station, pronto)?</p>
<p>Well, in news that might not be entirely welcome (<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/pre-christmas-work-stress-how-to-cope/467315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-Christmas stress</a>, anyone?), it turns out our brains have the very same function. Dubbed ’<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/productive-power-doing-nothing/739933" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">low power mode</a>’ by neurologist Dr Faye Begeti  (aka The Brain Doctor), <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/hustle-culture-habits-burnout/657222" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">running our batteries right down</a> has consequences. Here’s how to spot the signs you’re<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/doing-nothing-guilt/640232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> running on empty</a> – and what to do about it. </p>
<h2><\h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Woman looking tired and drained - low power mode" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/15112214/low-power-mode-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In order to understand the term ‘low power mode’, we need to consider how the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/brain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">human brain</a> works. You’re likely familiar with the idea of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/what-is-executive-functioning-disorder/800403" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">executive function</a> – this refers to the part of the brain that controls decision-making, logic and emotional regulation. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27274075/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research</a> shows that our capacity for executive function isn’t unlimited – put simply, we can overload our executive function capabilities, and they will show fatigue. </p>
<p>“Low power mode refers to a state where a device or a person operates with reduced energy consumption,” explains chartered psychologist <a href="https://www.drlouisegc.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Louise Goddard-Crawley</a>. “In technology, it’s a setting that extends battery life. In human terms, it’s a condition where individuals may experience decreased energy levels, both physically and mentally, often leading to fatigue and a sense of sluggishness.”</p>
<p>While the technology analogy is a useful one, there is one big difference between us and our phones: our phone can still function perfectly well on lower power mode. Humans are more complex. </p>
<p>“When we use the term ‘low power mode’ in the context of human energy levels, it’s important to note that it doesn’t imply that the individual is conserving energy in the way a device does,” says Dr Goddard-Crawley. “In human terms, it signifies a state of reduced personal energy, often associated with fatigue or decreased vitality and diminished well-being. In this case, it’s not a deliberate energy-saving strategy at all but rather an indication of being depleted or operating at suboptimal levels.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>You’re likely to have a pretty good sense of when you’re running out of metaphorical fuel. Feeling constantly <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/exhaustion-gap-women-tips/829811" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exhausted</a>, run down, sluggish and struggling to concentrate are all signs that we are operating on sub-optimal energy levels – and this impacts us both mentally and physically. </p>
<p>“The consequences of operating in low power mode are profound and wide-reaching,” warns Dr Goddard-Crawley. “Physically, this state compromises our immune system, leaving us more vulnerable to illnesses. The repercussions extend even to the potential development of auto-immune diseases.”</p>
<p>So, next time you’re constantly battling with a low-grade sniffle it might not just be the time of year that’s to blame – you might need to top up your self-care reserves. </p>
<p>And the signs of low power mode aren’t limited to physical symptoms either. </p>
<p>“Emotionally, the toll is evident in heightened irritability, diminished motivation and an overarching sense of emotional exhaustion,” says Dr Goddard-Crawley. “The strain doesn’t stop there; it permeates our cognitive functioning. Decision-making becomes compromised, marked by a tendency towards poor choices. You’re likely to struggle with forgetfulness and problem-solving.”</p>

<h4>The consequences are profound and wide-reaching.</h4>

</section>
<h2><\h2><p>Before we can think about dealing with our low battery power, it’s important to acknowledge that we are struggling. The signs may vary from person to person, but if you’re careful to tune-in to how you’re feeling, you’re likely to recognise your own individual tipping point. </p>
<p>“Recognising the signs of low power mode is vital,” says Dr Goddard-Crawly. “Try to understand the language your body and mind speak, and acknowledge when it’s time for positive intervention.” </p>
<p>If you’re unsure where to start, Dr Goddard-Crawley recommends the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Sleep is paramount; make sure you get sufficient, quality sleep. Establish a consistent sleep routine and integrate relaxation techniques like meditation or deep breathing into your daily regimen.</li>
<li>Regular exercise is a potent antidote to low energy levels. Whether it’s a brisk walk or a full workout, moving your body contributes significantly to overall vitality.</li>
<li>Nourish your body with a balanced diet. Opt for whole foods rich in nutrients and stay hydrated throughout the day to combat fatigue.</li>
<li>Infuse mindfulness into your daily life. Simple practices like mindful breathing can be transformative. Identify stressors, establish boundaries and engage in activities that bring calmness and joy.</li>
<li>Break down large tasks into smaller, achievable steps. Celebrate these victories to maintain a positive momentum that fuels motivation.</li>
<li>Designate periods for a digital detox. Limit screen time, especially before bedtime, to improve the quality of your sleep and promote overall well-being.</li>
<li>Nurture positive relationships with friends and family. Social connections provide a crucial support system that contributes to emotional well-being.</li>
<li>Dedicate time to activities that bring joy and relaxation. Pursue hobbies outside of work to strike a healthy balance in your life.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find yourself regularly running on empty, or if low power mode persists and significantly impacts your daily life, consider seeking professional support. </p>
<p>And finally, don’t forget that small changes can make a big difference. </p>
<p>“Remember, transformation is a process,” advises Dr Goddard-Crawley, “and each small change contributes to a significant overall shift in your well-being.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Have you ever played padel?” If you’ve been asked this question over the last couple of months, you’re certainly not alone.  </p>
<p>The number of people playing padel in the UK has grown slowly over the last decade or so – but the surge in popularity it’s seen over the last 12 months has made it clear that the racket sport is firmly here to stay. It’s estimated that <a href="https://www.lta.org.uk/news/why-is-padel-so-popular-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">90,000 people across Britain</a> now play the sport on an annual basis, with sales of padel rackets at sports retailer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/11/uk-sports-retailers-padel-pickleball-equipment-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decathlon</a> increasing by between 120% and 190% every year since 2019.  </p>
<p>As far as the rest of us are concerned, experts are already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/oct/31/padel-racket-sport-uk-boom-jurgen-klopp-van-dijk-andy-murray" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicting</a> that padel could be the UK’s next mass participation sport. And with everyone from <a href="https://unsquashable.com/blogs/padelized/why-is-tennis-legend-sir-andy-murray-such-a-big-fan-of-padel-tennis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tennis aficionados</a> and <a href="https://theathletic.com/4841625/2023/09/10/messi-ronaldo-neymar-padel-football/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">professional footballers</a> to complete beginners now vying to get a taste of the action, it feels as if those predictions could quickly be coming true. </p>
<p>To see what all the fuss is about, Strong Women editor Miranda Larbi and I headed down to <a href="https://www.padium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Padium</a> – Canary Wharf’s shiny new dedicated padel club – to take part in a training session with none other than the UK’s number one padel player, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jorgemartinezdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jorge Martínez</a>.  </p>
<p>Over the course of an hour we swung, jumped and lunged around the court as we got to grips with the basics. Here’s how we got on.  </p>
<h2><\h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="A padel racket" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/10/27150051/padel-racket-1120x1120.jpg">

<p>A mix between tennis and squash, padel originates from Mexico, where the first recognised court was set up by businessman Enrique Corcuera in 1969. Later, it made its way to Spain, where it remains widely popular; according to the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), the country has more than 20,000 padel courts.  </p>
<p>So what does a game of padel involve? To begin with, a padel court is smaller than a tennis court, measuring 20 metres long and 10 metres wide. It’s surrounded by walls on all sides – the back walls are made of glass, which also wraps around some of the sides of the court. The rest of the walls are metallic mesh.  </p>
<p>The rules of padel are simple. It’s scored the same way as tennis, but the serve (which has to land in the opposite box) is underarm. The ball is allowed to bounce off of the back and side walls (following a serve, it’s only allowed to hit the glass), but must only hit the ground once before it’s returned. Two bounces, and the other team receives a point.  </p>
<p>Oh, and it’s predominantly played in doubles, so you don’t have to worry about facing an opponent alone.  </p>
<h2><\h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Lauren and Miranda at padel" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/10/27145929/strong-women-padel-1120x1120.jpg">

</figure>
<p>I’ve never been a big fan of tennis, but I found that I took to padel relatively quickly. This is a common experience, and one Martínez says makes the sport so great. Even complete beginners can pick up the basics within an hour or so, mainly because the court is smaller (so you need less power to play a good shot than in tennis) and you don’t need to learn any complicated serving techniques to start a game.  </p>
<p>After practising our forehand and backhand swing and doing a few serves, we lined up on the opposite side of the court from Martínez to practise a few returning shots. </p>
<p>This was where things got complicated – trying to hit a ball you’re bouncing is one thing, but having someone else hit it at you means you have to respond to a whole load of different positions. I was (mostly) fine with the forehand swings but my backhand ones went everywhere, with a couple even making it up and over the court walls.  </p>
<p>Allowing the ball to ricochet off the back wall before attempting to hit it was even more tricky. You have to position yourself in the right place to hit it straight after it comes off the wall so it doesn’t bounce again, but also not move yourself too far backwards that you miss the ball entirely. As someone who can be particularly clumsy, I found all this hand-eye-ball coordination a little (very) demanding.  </p>
<p>In the end, though, I hit a fair few good shots and ended the session feeling confident. Because playing padel requires less effort than tennis, you don’t end a session feeling completely drained, either – which is perfect if you want to slot it in amid a busy schedule. It’s also a pretty good full-body workout: the day after, I could feel the strain in my wrists and upper arms, and my legs were definitely a little fatigued.  </p>
<p>And the best bit? It’s bloody good fun. Looking around at everyone else playing, it quickly became clear that padel is just as much about the social atmosphere as it is being competitive; I didn’t feel like my beginner ability was out of place or frowned upon. </p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a new sport to get your teeth into, I’d recommend giving padel a go. Even Miranda – a self-confessed ball sport hater – enjoyed her time on the court, and we’re on the hunt for our next opportunity to get stuck in. Why not grab a friend and see what all the fuss is about? If our experience is anything to go by, you might just find a new favourite hobby. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year Hannah, a 29-year-old writer, had the curious experience of realising she was dreaming while still inside of her dream. “I’d cut my hair short in my dream, which I hadn’t in real life, which is what made me realise I was asleep.” Now awake to the fact she was dreaming, Hannah decided to turn the roads in her dream into a rollercoaster-style transport system to ride around on – just one of the many adventures she has since enjoyed in her sleep. “I’ve given myself the power to fly and meet famous people while asleep,” she continues. “I do it for the fun of it.”</p>
<p>Welcome to the world of lucid dreaming, a fantastical practice on the rise in which the sleeper develops an awareness of the fact that they are in a dream – but doesn’t wake up. What happens after that varies across a spectrum that ranges from the fleeting realisation that it’s all ‘just a dream’ to the dreamer taking full control of the nocturnal narrative.</p>
<section class="pp-article__boxout">
<div id="boxout_1" class="pp-boxout" style="background-color:#606060;">
<div class="pp-boxout__body">
<h4>I can change the course of the dream and wake up calmer</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>Interest in the phenomenon is growing, with studies showing that it can spark <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/IC.31.3.f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creative thinking</a> and even improve <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/142/7/1988/5506053?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">athletic performance,</a> leading to the suggestion that we could be sleeping on an incredible tool. Interest in the area is so strong that a company called Prophetic AI has recently raised more than $1 million (£804,000) in funding for a device called ‘the Halo’, which is hoped to use generative AI (similar to that behind ChatGPT) on brain data to induce dreamers into a lucid state. If you find the idea of ‘non-invasive neurostimulation’ alarming, rest assured that it’s all still hypothetical at this stage.</p>
<p>It’s also, perhaps unsurprisingly, huge on TikTok, where a world of how-to videos set against trippy psychedelic backgrounds have amassed 1.4 billion views on the #LucidDreams hashtag at the time of writing. But how does one enter a state of lucid dreaming? There is some scientifically backed advice on how to enter a lucid state while dreaming, like the ‘mnemonic induction of lucid dreams’ or MILD technique, which involves setting the intention to lucid dream simply by repeatedly telling yourself that you’ll realise you’re dreaming when you are asleep.</p>
<p>Then there’s the more esoteric TikTok lore, like not looking into a mirror in a lucid dream, which can apparently turn it into a nightmare (and having caught sight of myself in the bathroom mirror in the middle of the night while awake, I don’t doubt it). For Hannah, it’s a matter of recognising where she is. “I’m usually in a familiar place, such as my house, in a lucid dream,” she explains. “But then I’ll notice one thing that’s slightly odd or doesn’t seem real, which triggers the realisation that I’m not awake. From there, I try to push the limits of what the dream can do.” </p>
<p>While these dreams have been typically used as a lighthearted way to have fun – think meeting a celebrity or travelling somewhere far-flung – they’re also becoming a wellness practice for some. “I use it to soften my anxiety,” explains Ellie, 27. “If something is stressful in my real life then I tend to dream about it. When I lucid dream, however, I’m able to take control of the narrative and change it. I’ve been doing it for years. Even during my GCSEs I would have dreams that I didn’t turn up to the exam but I’d be able to change the course of the dream and wake up feeling calmer.” </p>
<p>Understandably, this is the aspect researchers and venture capitalists (like those who invested in the AI Halo device) are increasingly interested in. The appeal lies in lucid dreaming’s potential ability to help us live a better life when we’re awake. </p>
<p>“The potential of lucid dreaming is mind-blowing,” says Dr Clare Johnson, author of <i>The Art Of Lucid Dreaming</i> and the first person to ever complete a PhD on it as a creative tool. “Scientific and academic studies show that people can improve motor skills, such as swimming strokes, heal from traumatic nightmares and communicate with researchers, from the dream state. As technology improves, we will likely see the fine-tuning of lucid dream masks and other devices that reliably trigger lucid awareness in sleeping people.” </p>
<p>While this feels novel, the phenomenon of lucid dreaming dates back millennia, with descriptions and allusions visible everywhere from ancient Eastern texts to Aristotle’s 4th century treatise <i>On Dreaming</i>. It wasn’t until 1913 that the term lucid dreaming was coined by Dutch psychiatrist Frederik van Eeden, and later it would be clinically studied and verified in the 1970s and 80s. Now, there’s growing interest in learning how to lucid dream intentionally, with research suggesting that it can achieve remarkable effects. These include managing stress and anxiety, as Ellie describes, but also enhancing creativity, improving athletic performance and even treating serious psychological disorders <a href="https://www.ptsduk.org/lucid-dreaming-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">such as PTSD</a>. </p>
<p>Harriet, a 30-year-old lucid dreamer, has her own methods of accessing the state. “It’s always more likely in that ‘second round’ of sleep you have, say, on a Sunday where you have nowhere to be and can drift off again,” she says. “I’ve noticed it’s also easier to get back into the dreams if you keep your head in the same position and other things like that, weirdly.” Harriet has been lucid dreaming since she was a child, but has had greater impetus to use it in adulthood. “When I was a kid it was just fairly obvious  stuff – I would fly around or revisit Disneyland,” she says. “In adult life I’ll use it if I’m nervous about doing something – a new job or a project I’m working on – and it essentially gives you the comfort of having already gone through <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/first-day-nerves-new-job/819613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first-day anxiety</a>. I’ve also come up with solutions to issues with work through doing it.”</p>
<section class="pp-article__boxout">
<div id="boxout_1" class="pp-boxout" style="background-color:#606060;">
<div class="pp-boxout__body">
<h4>The role of our dreams is for us to process information</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>Along with stress management and problem-solving, Johnson points to the particular benefit lucid dreaming can have for those with physical limitations. “I have worked with blind people, paraplegics, cancer patients and those with serious chronic health issues,” she says. “Lucid dreaming provides a healing and joyful escape, freeing them briefly from their daily struggles with pain. It’s a powerful arena for psychological growth and healing, as well as a place to experience marvellous things.”</p>
<p>Clearly, there is a lot of value in lucid dreaming – just so long as you’re capable of doing it, of course. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230413-what-are-the-best-lucid-dreaming-techniques" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studies have shown</a> that while it is possible to learn, the time it takes to master the skill varies vastly from person to person. Some can learn how to do it straight away (prompted by something as simple as reading an article about the subject) while others might take months or never experience it at all. With some TikTok videos informing viewers that they’re ‘wasting time’ sleeping if they’re not lucid dreaming, the idea can feel a little too much like another way to maximise productivity and ‘hack’ every element of life. It’s not what you want to hear if you just need a proper night’s sleep. </p>
<p>Because as fun and useful as it sounds, lucid dreaming can also be a little tiring. In fact, as Dr Lindsay Browning, a psychologist, neuroscientist and sleep expert at And So To Bed, notes, despite the exciting potential, it could also be detrimental to our sleep. “Although many people want to increase how often they have a lucid dream as it can be fun to change them, or good to reduce nightmares, it isn’t always helpful,” she says. “This is because the role of our dreams is for us to process information and emotions that we experience during the day. If we’re aware that we’re dreaming, we are not fully in this restorative dream state.”</p>
<p>I can’t help but find this a reassuring counter-argument. Because, while lucid dreaming clearly has its benefits, something is unsettling about the idea of having a new skill to master during your sleeping hours. If you have the willpower and inclination to explore the phenomenon, then more power to you – whether it’s just for fun as it was for Hannah or for more significant reasons like avoiding nightmares and managing stress. But if, like me, you find that you can’t do it, there’s no shame in giving up and enjoying a dreamless, restful night’s sleep. Sweet dreams – whatever you get up to once you shut your eyes. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i style="">This week we’re chatting with success coach <a href="https://www.geetasidhu-robb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="">Geeta Sidhu-Robb</a>.</i></p>
<p><b>Hi, Geeta! If you could recommend One Good Thing everyone can do to improve their mental health, what would it be?</b></p>
<p>Accept that uncomfortable emotions will happen. Understand that we regularly get uncomfortable feelings that arise from events, interactions, work or just something as simple as when your favourite dress doesn’t seem to fit you today. These feelings cause acute discomfort, so we tend to try to avoid them in any way we can.</p>
<p><b>Why is embracing uncomfortable feelings your One Good Thing?</b></p>
<p>Because change is inevitable, and suffering is optional. What I mean by that is that I know I want to keep getting better at things and be happier, but I can’t do that without changing. So, I have found a way to embrace change, because I understand there’s always ultimately something better at the end of it. </p>
<p><b>How does your One Good Thing work in practice?</b></p>
<p>It’s based on the principle that growth does not come through pain. Growth comes through reflection, and reflection usually (unfortunately) comes through pain.  So, if we just start on reflection sooner in the process, it makes it all easier and less painful.</p>

<h4>Change is inevitable, and suffering is optional</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p><b>What are the benefits of this approach?</b></p>
<p>I have learned to avoid massive lows and low-hanging anxiety. It’s a really great learning to detach from circumstances as they happen, so you can see them more calmly and react more calmly.  This usually leads to a better result because you are dealing with the root cause of the problem.</p>
<p><b>Are there any common pitfalls we tend to stumble into? How can we avoid these?</b></p>
<p>Almost no change feels good at the beginning. You can get swept up in that feeling of being out of control and powerless before you know it, and it takes habit to pull yourself back into remembering you don’t have to feel bad right now.  What you have to ‘feel’ is the uncomfortable truth under that emotion. </p>
<p>For example,  if someone wants to break up with you, instead of feeling like you have been betrayed and now will be alone forever, sit with the feeling that you know this relationship is not right for you, this person is not making you happy and this change will free you up from playing small and stifling your needs.  And then… more good can come into your life.</p>
<p><b>How do you personally do your One Good Thing?</b></p>
<p>I do a daily ‘sweep’ of my emotions and focus on the one that I really want to ignore that feels uncomfortable. Then I sit with that and let myself feel it and flow through the truth in it. Sometimes I don’t manage to catch it and I’ll find myself heading for a doughnut with urgency, and I’ll think, ‘Oh, hang on – is there something I’m avoiding thinking about?’ So, I’ll allow those feelings… while I eat the doughnut.</p>
<p><b>How has doing this changed your life for the better?</b></p>
<p>I need very little recovery time from any change because I don’t see change as bad anymore; it’s just the flow of life. It makes growing myself, my business and my clients much easier. It’s created a fluid life for me based on more expectations of good things than the previous fear of the future I would have. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day, my friend from university and I were bent double in a cafe, sniggering into our flat whites over the questionable <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/fashion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outfit choices</a> we used to make as students, when it struck me that my <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/friendship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">friends</a> fall into three categories.  </p>
<p>There are the wonderful ones, like her, who I have a shared history with, and we spend most of our time together reminiscing about the people we used to know and the things we used to do. Then there are the friends who are very much present in my day-to-day life, who I will go to first if I’ve had a rough day at <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/careers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work</a> or need some <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/advice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advice</a>. The final category is the friends with whom I dream big about the future: we put the world to rights, plan our lives and egg each other on to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/quiet-promotion-work-extra-responsibility-pay-rise/743390" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">go for the promotion</a> or make that move.  </p>
<p>Of course, some of my friendships transcend these boxes, but on the whole I seem to have three types: the ones rooted in the past, the ones focused on the present and the ones that are all about the future. Most of us, to some degree, settle into these dynamics in our relationships, and I wonder what it tells us about ourselves and the way we relate to our friends. Are all of these friendship archetypes helpful, and are they healthy?  </p>
<p>These are the questions I put to Dr Annie Zimmerman, psychotherapist and author of the upcoming book <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/4756/9781398716018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Your Pocket Therapist</i></a>. Here’s what she had to say about past, present and future-facing friendships. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>Lots of us have friends we made early in life. Maybe they’re the people you clicked with at school or lived with at university, or your parents were friends and you grew up together. Often, we grow to be quite different from our childhood companions, which naturally means our conversations drift back to the one thing we still have in common: shared memories. </p>
<p>“Often, in our busy lives, all we’re doing with our friends is catching up,” says Zimmerman. “If it’s someone from your past, you tend to reminisce about things that happened back then even though that’s not what your life looks like anymore.” This can be a great source of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/comfort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comfort</a>, she says, a way to make you feel tethered to who you were. “Having friends who’ve known you through different eras is really valuable,” she says. </p>
<p>What you should look out for, though, is when this kind of friendship starts to feel like it’s hit a wall. “Sometimes we can be clinging on to past versions of ourselves through our friendships,” says Zimmerman. “If you still feel <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/family-friends/lost-friendships/604396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">connected through remembering</a>, that’s great, but if your relationship starts to feel stuck and stagnant it’s worth thinking about how you can evolve it. Having new experiences and creating new memories together is a great way to get to know each other as the people you are now.” </p>

<h4>It’s human to crave connection and familiarity</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<h2><\h2><p>A friendship that’s rooted in the present is the one we lean on for day-to-day support and companionship – that person you talk to most regularly, share every meme with and call as soon as there’s a story to tell or issue to unpick. “It’s human to crave connection and familiarity, especially <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/pressure-to-date-be-productive-when-single-2/821608" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when you’re single</a> – your friends become really important to lean on,” Zimmerman says. </p>
<p>But we should be wary of expecting anyone to be there for us 24/7. “If you have a need to be constantly talking to someone and feel like it’s impossible to sit with yourself, that may be a signpost not necessarily of closeness with your friend but of anxiety about being alone. It’s worth experimenting with some distance just to see if that’s true and what might be causing it.” </p>
<h2><\h2><p>There are some people we can meet up with and it’s guaranteed that we’ll walk away feeling uplifted and inspired. Having friends to dream with, who propel us forward with their big ideas and belief in our potential, is an utter joy. They can be the difference between going for an exciting opportunity or playing it safe, and they’re amazing to have around, says Zimmerman.  </p>
<p>She has noticed that a small number of these “onwards and upwards” friendships can tip over into something more toxic, however. “There can be real support in spending time with someone who is working on their goals in the same way you are, but things can get a little fraught if a friend wanting the best for you and trying to offer advice starts to sound like they’re criticising you,” she says. </p>
<p>“We’re kind of told that a friend should always be upfront and tell us exactly what they think we should do, but we should be able to be the flawed, imperfect humans we are without a friend always pushing us to be better.” </p>
<p>Taking a closer look at our friendships through the lens of these past, present and future-facing dynamics can be a valuable way to notice what’s working and what might need to change. Ultimately, though, Zimmerman believes that nurturing different types of relationships is a positive thing.  </p>
<p>“There is a lot of rhetoric around at the moment that encourages us to ‘cut people off’ as soon as they’re not serving us, but it’s OK to have friends in our lives that don’t meet every single one of our needs,” she says. </p>
<p>“It’s OK to have friends from your past who you might be really different from now, but you still get a warm feeling when you see them and they’re still a part of who you are. It’s also OK to seek out new friends who understand who you are now or who you want to be in future. All of them are valuable in their own way.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you’re sick, you need something warm, comforting and packed with nourishing ingredients. You don’t want to spend hours faffing in the kitchen either – the perfect dinner for a bad cold has to be whipped up in under 20 minutes. Mercifully, this vegan dan dan noodle dish ticks all the boxes. </p>
<p>You’ve got a hearty dose of protein from the tofu (you need protein to build and repair body tissue and fight viral and bacterial infections), while getting a glut of inflammation-busting spices in the form of ginger, cinnamon, allspice and cumin. Allspice is thought to boast anticancer, antifungal, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as helping with blood sugar control. Cinnamon does the same kind of thing while being known to be loaded with antioxidants. In fact, the antioxidant effects of cinnamon are so powerful that you’re supposed to be able to use the spice <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8433798/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as a natural food preservative</a>.  </p>
<p>Ginger, meanwhile, is a go-to cold remedy. Its medicinal properties are again thought to reduce inflammation and soothe sore throats. It’s also thought to speed up cold recovery time by enhancing immunity, with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23123794/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one lab study</a> finding that ginger stimulates the immune system to kill viruses.</p>
<h2><\h2><p>3 tbsp vegetable oil </p>
<p>280g extra firm tofu </p>
<p>2 tbsp tahini </p>
<p>10g fresh ginger </p>
<p>1 clove(s) garlic </p>
<p>1 tsp caster sugar </p>
<p>½ tsp ground cinnamon </p>
<p>½ tsp ground allspice </p>
<p>½ tsp ground cumin </p>
<p>100g flat rice noodles </p>
<p>3 spring onion(s) </p>
<p>20g fresh coriander </p>
<p>1 tbsp light soy sauce </p>
<h2><\h2><p>1. Fill a kettle with water and put it on to boil. This will be for the noodles later.</p>
<div>
<p>2. Next, place a large frying pan over a high heat and drizzle in 3 tbsp of vegetable oil.</p>
<p>3. Once the oil starts to shimmer and loosen, crumble in the 280g block of tofu. Fry the tofu for 6-8 minutes, tossing occasionally, until golden and crisp in places. Get on with the rest of the dish in the next steps while you wait.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>4. Add 2 tbsp of tahini and 1 tbsp of soy sauce to a large mixing bowl. Peel, then finely grate in 10g of ginger and 1 clove of garlic. Add 1 tsp of sugar.</p>
<p>5. Give everything a good mix and season to taste with a little more soy sauce if necessary.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>6. Once the tofu is crisp in places, tip in ½ tsp each of cinnamon, allspice and cumin. Toss and fry for a further 1-2 minutes, then take the pan off the heat. Season to taste with salt.</p>
<p>7. Now, cook the noodles. Add 100g of noodles to a medium saucepan and tip in enough boiling water from the kettle to just cover them. Place the pan over a high heat and boil for 3-4 minutes, until soft but still with a slight bite.</p>
</div>
<p>8. While the noodles cook, thinly slice 3 spring onions.</p>
<div>
<p>9. When the noodles are ready, use tongs to transfer them into the bowl with the sauce. Add spring onions and 15g of the coriander – you’ll use the rest for garnish later. Toss everything together, and loosen with a splash of the noodle’s cooking water if necessary. The sauce should coat the noodles in a silky sauce.</p>
<p>10. Divide the noodles between bowls and spoon over the spiced tofu. Dress with the remaining 5g of coriander and serve.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our hair-washing routines are as individual as we are. Some people do it every day; others will <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/how-to-revive-second-day-hair/837667" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">avoid it for as long as possible</a>. Then there are those who set aside a whole day each week for a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/skincare/seaweed-bathing-skin-benefits/829919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">big shower</a>, which includes using everything from <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/philip-kingsley-elasticizer-review-uk-where-to-buy/403098" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-shampoo treatments</a> to intensive <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/how-to-use-a-hair-mask-properly/610469" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hair masks</a> and post-wash <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/best-leave-in-conditioner/591943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leave-in</a> products. </p>
<p>And while we’ve all formed our own habits by now, it’s likely that you’re <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/shampoo-hair-washing-tips-from-hairdressers/786498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washing your hair</a> out of habit rather than because you’re listening to what it needs. “It’s about taking a mindful approach,” says hairstylist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R1FKtlpy2s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Smith</a>. “What I mean by that is that you need to do a bit of trial and error with different products and different frequencies. If your scalp starts to get itchy or feel uncomfortable, that’s a really clear sign that you need to wash your hair.”</p>
<p>Smith goes on to explain that how your <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/scalp-care-best-products-treatments/282409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scalp</a> feels and what it needs should be the primary concern, and secondary to that is what your hair feels like it needs. “Of course, every time you wash and reset your hair, you’re likely to be processing it in some way, whether that’s blow drying or using straighteners,” he says. “And if that is the case, then washing your hair less frequently is going to help hair become more healthy over time.”</p>
<p>However, for those with problematic scalps and those who suffer from <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/how-to-treat-an-itchy-scalp-products/312599" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itchiness or flakiness</a>, washing it – and therefore your hair – more frequently, despite what your hair needs, is important. “That’s what’s going to make you feel better and provide a healthier scalp that will grow healthier hair,” explains Smith.</p>
<h3><b>The best type of shampoo to use</b></h3>
<p>It’s easy to get drawn into the endless claims and promises that shampoos often make, but Smith explains that if your hair is feeling like it needs to be washed more than you think is necessary then you could be using the wrong shampoo.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);">“The primary function of a shampoo is to clean and reset your hair, so if you’re using something that’s really heavy and is trying to do too much, then it’s probably not going to be cleaning your hair properly in the first place,” he says.</span></p>
<p>“So, if in doubt, use a lightweight shampoo that doesn’t make too many claims. Clarifying and deep cleansing shampoos can be good too, but not all of them are suitable to use every day or during every wash, so it’s best to alternate them with your regular one.” </p>
<h3><b>How to shampoo hair properly</b></h3>
<p>Finally, how you use shampoo is also important. It might seem like a simple task, but because it’s something we all do so mindlessly, there’s likely to be room for improvement. </p>
<p>“First, it’s important to make sure you’re distributing the shampoo properly over your scalp before you start lathering it up,” says Smith. “Tap it onto different areas of your scalp, then rub your hands together and start to lather it in. The sign of clean hair is that there’s even lather through your scalp, so it’s important to systematically move from one area to another.”</p>
<p>Then, it could be worth doing a second shampoo. It’s something that happens when you’re in the hairdressers so it makes sense to also incorporate a double cleanse into your at-home hair-washing routine. </p>
<p>“That’s really going to set you up for success in terms of achieving a longer lasting style and a better-looking blow dry,” explains Smith.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s easy to feel lost and disillusioned when navigating 2023 as a young person. With growing CO2 emissions and sea levels on the rise, the planet is reaching a crisis point. Where consumers are concerned, we all still want to look good, feel good and still somehow do good, so we’re left with two choices: to stand back or to get up and do something.</p>
<p>Some people have chosen to step up, including award-winning circular <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fashion</a>&nbsp;pioneer Phoebe English, who is on a mission to change things. Off the back of sourcing and repurposing deadstock fabric, she has been recognised by the British Fashion Council as a leader of change, building a formidable brand grounded in an ethically conscious ethos and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/sustainability" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sustainably</a>-driven practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re living in a time where we’re producing more clothing than we physically use, and far outstretching the realities of our planetary boundaries,” she tells Stylist from her London studio. “It’s my job as a fashion designer to think about how my role fits into the current climate context.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when English first started her namesake label in 2011, the world of planet-conscious clothing was largely limited, she says. “It’s been interesting to see the response to us as we’ve developed ways of working with design and the surrounding systems that align within the realities of our <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/long-reads/climate-change-feminist-issue-burden-on-women-save-planet/287474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planet</a>.”</p>
<p>The industry is awash with climate commitments from brands and a flurry of trends making sustainability feel somewhat like a buzzword. And so English is trying to make it a little easier for us all, having recently joined forces with the Kentucky-based bourbon maker Maker’s Mark on an upcycled made-to-order capsule for the holiday party season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sleek <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/coats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jackets</a>, reconstructed <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/trousers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trousers</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/dresses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dresses </a>to twirl around in – these are just a few of the wondrous new pieces on offer from her limited (Re)Made to Party capsule.</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Phoebe English x Maker's Mark - Phoebe with full collection" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/17110350/phoebe-english-x-makers-mark-phoebe-with-full-collection-crop-1700219057-1302x1302.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Phoebe English x Maker's Mark - Phoebe with full collection</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Her designs are “eclectic, inviting and colourful”, proof of the difference small changes can make. No wonder the brand has seduced countless editorials and magazine pages, all while eschewing the likes of leather, feathers and fur. </p>
<p>But English isn’t taken in by the acclaim and accolades. Instead, her focus is always on creating better products for a better consumer and better planet. When working on a collection, she thinks about how a Phoebe English-designed piece should make us feel: effortless, comfortable and above all conscious of our relationship with the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/clothes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clothes</a> we buy. “Once you know the scale of how much we’re producing and how much we’re wasting, it’s really hard to design without that in mind,” she shares.</p>
<p>Change is afoot, but there’s much still to be done. Looking ahead, English hopes to forge a rebellion from within the next crop of creative talent. “We must equip the younger generation with the knowledge of how to embed circular practices into their <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design</a> work so we can create in less damaging ways.”</p>
<p>As the consequences of climate change escalate with each year, she says there is still reason to remain positive. “Human beings have a really amazing ability to adapt.” By proposing a different idea of what fashion can be, she says change can “really start to happen”.  </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Preparing for a job interview can often feel like an emotional rollercoaster. From <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/what-to-wear-to-a-job-interivew/659294" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deciding what to wear</a> to pumping yourself up beforehand, there’s a lot to do – and that’s not forgetting the effort involved in preparing responses to those commonly asked questions. </p>
<p>While these questions are pretty simple on the surface, knowing how to answer them in a way that showcases your skills in the best possible way is a little trickier. This is especially true when it comes to the dreaded question: “Why do you want this role?” </p>
<p>Money aside, there are many reasons why a job might be appealing to you – but not all of those are going to make you the most desirable candidate. So how should you answer this question? We asked <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlotte-davies-14b49033/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlotte Davies</a>, career expert at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, to explain all. </p>
<h2><\h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="A woman talking during a job interview" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/02/16165901/job-interview-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>1. Make it about them</h3>
<p>On the most basic level, this question is designed to test your knowledge of the company and how your skills can contribute to its goals. With this in mind, you want to frame your answer around the organisation and how you fit into it and show off what you know. </p>
<p>“What this question really means is: ‘How can you contribute to the position and our company,’” Davies explains. “Don’t lead on what <i>you</i> want from the role, but what is great about <i>them</i> as a business. They want to assess your interest and commitment to their company, and see if you understand the position and how you plan on contributing to it.  </p>
<p>“This response should demonstrate that you’ve done your research, that you understand their culture and values and how they resonate with you.” </p>
<h3>2. Share what you want from the role </h3>
<p>It doesn’t have to be all about them, though. You can share what you want to achieve with the company – aligning those goals with the skills you can bring to the table.  </p>
<p>“Tell them what you want to gain from this opportunity – whether that’s specific skills and experience, as well as perhaps an alignment with a personal passion or interest,” Davies suggests. “Try to weave this into the context of what you can contribute to the position.</p>
<p>“The interviewer also wants to know what your long-term goals are and how this role fits in with them. Having an answer that addresses this demonstrates self-awareness and ambition. Feel free to be honest about this – if your interests aren’t aligned from the start, one or both of you may end up frustrated at some point.” </p>
<h3>3. Speak sincerely and from the heart </h3>
<p>While you want to deliver a considered answer, there’s no point in making things up on the spot. Speaking sincerely will ensure you’re not making empty promises and allow your potential employer to get a full idea of who you are and what you’re about. </p>
<p>“Authenticity is key to impressing an interviewer,” Davies says. “Being yourself (in a professional way) is the best approach to sincerely securing a job that you will enjoy and feel fulfilled by in the long term.  </p>
<p>“Many interviewers are aware of the pitfall commonplace responses that people ‘think’ they should give. Be authentic and you’ll hopefully garner more respect for this. Ensure that your personality shines through; the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/?u=36053556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn Learning</a> course <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/job-interviewing-for-leaders-and-managers/memorable-interview-answers-with-effective-storytelling?u=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Memorable Interview Answers With Effective Storytelling’</a> can give you inspiration on how to demonstrate this.” </p>

<p>If you’re someone who struggles with <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/seasonal-affective-disorder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seasonal affective disorder (SAD)</a> or <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/sleep/waking-up-dark-winter-grogginess/570581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finds it hard to wake up when the mornings are dark</a>, you’ll know what we’re talking about – those dreary conditions which creep in at this time of year leave you feeling pretty rubbish.</p>
<p>However, while it’s OK to sit with your emotions and acknowledge how you’re feeling, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/summer-autumn-season-change-dread-anxiety/707170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you’re not alone</a> – and there are steps you can take to ease the burden this time of year brings and help yourself feel better.  
	  </p>
<p>So, to find out more about what you can do to take care of your <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mental health</a> and wellbeing this autumn and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/winter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">winter</a>, <i>Stylist</i> spoke to <a href="https://www.beingwellfamily.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BeingWell</a> life coach Grace McMahon to get her expert insight. Here’s what she had to say. </p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">1. Balance your diet </h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>If you often find yourself feeling sluggish and flat during the colder months, the first step McMahon recommends is taking the time to make rich, nourishing foods.  </p>
<p>“The winter months <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/diet-changes-food-eating-habits-cold-weather/434344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can make us crave fast food, treats and sweets</a> as our bodies need more energy to keep warm while still doing everything we did in the warmer months: work, parenting, exercising,” she explains. “While a few sweeter delights aren’t going to harm us, make sure to balance this with nourishing food, too.” </p>
<p>To give yourself an extra boost, McMahon recommends adding healthy <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/food/hearty-stew-with-sweet-potato-mash-recipe-the-perfect-work-lunch-to-keep-you-energised-all-afternoon/516130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stews</a> and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/wonton-soup-recipe/499829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soups</a> to your diet – not only are they rich in vitamins and nutrients that will help your brain to function well and protect your ability to cope with daily life, but they’re also a great way to warm yourself up and take care of yourself when it’s cold and miserable outside. </p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 class="listicle__title">2. Maintain your vitamin D </h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>While most people should be able to make all the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/vitamin-d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vitamin D</a> they need from the sunlight between March and September, during the colder months you’ll need to take steps to ensure your vitamin D levels don’t slip.  </p>
<p>This is important for a number of reasons. Not only does vitamin D play a vital role in keeping our bones, teeth and muscles healthy, but <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/vitamin-d-benefits-nutrition-strength-training-boost-workout-exercise-tips/371604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies have shown</a> that vitamin D also helps to regulate <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/mood" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mood</a>. </p>
<p>Indeed, as McMahon explains: “Try taking vitamin D supplements alongside a balanced diet in the winter months to make up for the lost sunshine. It won’t ‘fix’ anything, but it might give you a little more of a boost and a smile through chattering teeth.”</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out the NHS website</a> for more information about taking a vitamin D supplement. </p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">3. Get cosy and comfy </h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>It may seem simple, but embracing the colder weather and taking steps to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/home/interior-design/autumn-refresh-renter-friendly-cosy-decor/570342" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make yourself feel cosy</a> and comfortable can make a big difference to your wellbeing. </p>
<p>“Feeling good in ourselves really helps to protect our mental health,” McMahon explains. “We’re more likely to feel better in ourselves if we’re comfortable, warm enough, cosy and settled.” </p>
<p class="">To help you get started, McMahon recommends adding a handful of ‘comfort’ items to your home and wardrobe. “You don’t have to spend a fortune, but <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/home/interior-design/autumn-refresh-renter-friendly-cosy-decor/570342" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adding some simple staples</a> like putting <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/home/cosy-weighted-blankets-sleep/572144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thick blankets</a> on the sofa can actually really help us to find comfort in winter – and in ourselves,” she says. </p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 class="listicle__title">4. Don’t let the cold hold you back </h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>You may <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/how-to-enjoy-winter-outdoor-exercise/841996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feel less-than motivated</a> to get outside when it’s windy and raining, but doing so can <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/health-benefits-outdoor-winter-exercise/338216#:~:text=During%20winter's%20dark%20days%2C%20it's,mood%20and%20lower%20stress%20levels." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">do you the world of good</a>. </p>
<p>After all, there’s a reason why <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/what-is-friluftsliv-open-air-living-nature-mental-health-benefits/445876" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Nordic concept of ‘friluftsliv’</a> or open air living is so popular in Scandinavian countries during the winter months – embracing the outdoors and staying active is important no matter what time of the year it is. </p>
<p>“Fresh air, albeit crispier and icier at this time of year, is still great for clearing the mind and getting oxygen into the lungs and brain,” McMahon says. “Try brisk walks through the park paired with a hot drink to stop your fingers falling off.” </p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 class="listicle__title">5. Listen to what you need</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>While taking care of yourself is important all-year round, taking the time to listen to your body and mind – and giving them what they need – is even more crucial when you’re feeling rough. </p>
<p>“The gloominess of winter can be hard to manage for many of us, but you can make it your own – whether that’s by starting the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/film/best-netflix-christmas-films/436028" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas movie</a> marathon early or making an effort to maintain your all-year routine,” McMahon says. </p>
<p>“Try to embrace it rather than feel intimidated, and if <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/bed-rot-trend-tiktok/799532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a duvet day</a> is required just to help keep you warm and sane, that’s OK too.” </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world is dark and impossibly miserable at the moment, so it’s about time the TV gods blessed us with a new sitcom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, the BBC has come up trumps with <i>Such Brave Girls</i>, which promises to be engrossing, relatable and seriously funny. And, yes, considering it hails from the producers of our beloved&nbsp;<i>I May Destroy You</i>, it seems entirely reasonable to get excited about it.</p>
<p><b>Watch the trailer for <i>Such Brave Girls</i> below:</b></p>
<p>Intrigued? Here’s what you need to know.</p>
<h3>What is <i>Such Brave Girls</i> about?</h3>
<p>As per the original BBC synopsis, this dysfunctional family sitcom follows sisters Josie and Billie, along with their single mother Deb, as they “navigate life armed with nothing but poor judgment and self-esteem exclusively tied to people who couldn’t care less about them”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“They’re vain, selfish, heavily in debt, pathologically desperate for affection and bursting with misplaced, terrifying love,” it adds.</p>
<p>Basically, go into this one expecting to explore&nbsp;life and love in all its ugly chaos.</p>
<h3>Who stars in <i>Such Brave Girls</i>?</h3>
<p>Louise Brealey steps into the shoes of Deb, the family’s matriarch, while real-life sisters Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson take on the roles of Josie and Billie respectively.</p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">BBC</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Paul Bazeley, Richard Cunningham, Haruka Kuroda, Tina Louise Owens, Jennifer Daley and Amy Trigg also star.</p>
<h3>What are people saying about<i> Such Brave Girls</i>?</h3>
<p>Sadler, who is also the writer and creator of the BBC sitcom, says that it was inspired by a phone call she had with her sister at the start of lockdown.</p>
<p>“Neither of us had been speaking much, and over the phone I had to tell her I’d been sectioned, and then she told me she ended up with £20,000 worth of debt that she’d been keeping a secret,” she explains. “I don’t know how we’d been keeping these big secrets from each other for a really long time. We both just burst out laughing after we’d told each other what had happened, and it made me realise that you do just deal with the most serious things through comedy.</p>
<p>“The world is a scary place and if I can do anything to make things feel more manageable or funny, or take the sting out of bits of life that people might be scared or embarrassed or ashamed to talk about, then I’ve done my job.”</p>
<p>Brealey, meanwhile, describes the series as being “the story of a 21st century family: two sisters who are ‘wet for trauma’ and utterly unequipped for adulthood, and their glorious, useless mother-from-hell who will happily threaten to slit their throats in their beds if they don’t stop being weird in front of her rich new boyfriend. So, something for everyone.”</p>
<p>Consider us sold.</p>
<h3>When and where can we watch <i>Such Brave Girls</i>?</h3>
<p><i>Such Brave Girls</i> is available from Wednesday 22 November at 10pm on BBC Three and BBC iPlayer.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s a key part of the traditional <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/happiness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“happily ever after”</a> <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/relationships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">relationship</a> narrative. You meet your partner, you <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/love" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fall in love</a>, and you eventually decide to merge your lives, schedules and novelty mug collection by <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/long-reads/coronavirus-couples-moving-in-together-first-time-relationship-advi/370852" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moving in together</a>.</p>
<p>But, like most things in life, this <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/successful-relationship-secret-happiness-satisfaction-new-study/413553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">relationship milestone</a> may not be altogether what you expect – especially if you’ve never done it before. It may highlight things about <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/long-reads/living-with-an-ex-breakup-advice-relationship-flatshare/335234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your partner</a> – and yourself – that make you question the compatibility of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/relationship-advice-mindfulness-non-reactivity-stress-relief-study/429393" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your relationship</a>. Or, it might bring you <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/long-distance-relationship-lockdown-how-to-maintain-intimacy-feel-connected/397677" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closer together</a>. The trick is how to navigate this <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/quiet-noisy-decisions-life-advice-tips/393224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">life decision</a>.</p>
<p>The first rule? Don’t fool yourself into believing that <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/relationships-honeymoon-period-breakups-repetitive-patterns-relationship-mistakes/291521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nothing will change</a> after you and your partner decide to live under the same roof. “It can be easy for people to assume that everything will be consistent to how it was before you move in with a partner – but there will often be surprises when you start to cohabit,” Dr Becky Spelman, psychologist at London’s <a href="https://theprivatetherapyclinic.co.uk/relationship-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Private Therapy Clinic</a>, says.  </p>
<p>While Georgina, 27, told <i>Stylist </i>that the experience of moving in with her partner often felt “like training a dog”, there are many ways to approach this massive life step that doesn’t involve obedience classes or a planned escape route.</p>

</figure>
<h2><\h2><p>First off, it’s important to have really honest conversations with your partner about why you are making this big move in the first place. Are you doing it because it is truly the best thing for you both, or are there <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial pressures</a> – or other things – at play? </p>
<p>Dating coach <a href="https://katemansfield.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Mansfield</a> warns that the motivations behind your decision are crucial. “It’s common to rush the process for financial reasons. But often that can backfire because it puts pressure on the relationship, creating issues,” she says.</p>
<p>If you can, the best thing is to take money out of the equation completely to make your choice, Mansfield recommends. “It’s helpful to think: ‘if I put money aside, would I still want to make this decision right now?’”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>After you’ve worked out these elements, communication is your next step. It’s absolutely key at every stage, but is integral at the beginning for setting out how you mean to go on.</p>
<p>Niamh, 26, realised soon after moving in that being super-clear about what she needed out of her partner was very helpful – rather than waiting around for him to figure it out and getting frustrated.</p>
<p>“I found I was just expecting [him] to be a mind reader and know exactly what I wanted and needed, and do it before I even asked,” she says. “But then I realised no, that’s bullshit. We’re all just people. Most of us want to do right by our partners, and right by our friends. So it’s better to just tell people what you need.”</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="A woman hanging a picture" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/02/03121157/a-woman-hanging-a-picture-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Oscar Wong on Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For Niamh, working in communications means that she really values quiet time to herself at the end of a busy day. So telling her partner about this was crucial, limiting the chance of arguments or tensions when she wasn’t feeling sociable. “For me, it was all about being able to communicate to your partner like: ‘Babe, I love you, but can we chat tomorrow or can we just watch a film in silence tonight?’” Niamh says. </p>
<p>Couples therapist <a href="https://www.kalanitbenari.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Kalanit Ben-Ari</a> warns against communicating in a “defensive” way, but instead trying to be as constructive as possible. “When one communicates in a defensive way – by ignoring, avoiding, shaming or criticising – it can create hurt, upset, and a rupture in connection,” she says. “In turn, this leads the partner to react in a defensive way. This creates a cycle of negativity, tension and stress.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>Megan, 27, moved in with her partner last year and quickly found herself caught up in doing his domestic chores, which wasn’t what she’d bargained for at all. “I felt like I had moved in and taken on the responsibility of his mum, who had done absolutely everything for him [before I’d moved in],” she says. “So I found myself doing his laundry, cleaning and tidying ALL the time. I put a stop to that pretty soon.”</p>
<p>Setting boundaries was a big move for Megan; communicating to her partner what she was and wasn’t prepared to do when it came to household tasks. “I made it clear from the beginning that if [my partner] wanted me to live with him, I would need my own space and equal responsibilities when it came to roles around the house.”</p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">10'000 Hours on Getty</figcaption>

<h2><\h2><p>Space is an important – and sometimes difficult – thing to get right with your partner when you’ve just moved in. But it’s crucial that you both take it, no matter how delightful the honeymoon period of super-accessible sex and spooning can be. Megan and her partner separated their stuff out into separate bedrooms, to maintain some places of individual refuge. “It was exactly what I needed after living independently for so many years,” she says. “I didn’t love feeling like we were living on top of each other.”</p>
<p>Georgia, 26, lived with a former partner at the age of 20 and insists that having separate bedrooms (if possible) is a lifesaver at times of conflict. “When any friends of mine are looking to move in with a partner, I tell them one thing – you need a door,” she tells <i>Stylist</i>. “You really need a door to close if you get into arguments. You don’t want to be sat in the same room without any space to cool down. That’s going to make things 10 times worse.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>Whatever physical space you’re moving into and sharing with your partner, try to take time to do your own thing, while also carving out time for your significant other. Dr Ben-Ari says these check-ins can make up a regular routine of activities like “eating together, communicating your deepest thoughts, feelings, desires and dreams, prioritising ‘us’ time and having dates without technology”.
	  </p>
<h2><\h2><p>A crucial red flag to watch out for is feelings or habits of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/codependency-relationship/628107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">co-dependence</a> – do you feel excessively emotionally or psychologically reliant on your partner? This may spell trouble in a cohabitation setting, and living together in close quarters may make it easier for a controlling dynamic like this to present itself.</p>
<p>For Georgia, her and her partner’s co-dependent habits while living together were a major part of the relationship’s downfall. “Our whole problem was that we spent too much time together, we were really co-dependent,” she says. “We would start to take on each other mood’s and get on each other’s nerves unnecessarily. It left me feeling so drained.</p>
<p>“We’d try and take time apart, but would end up giving up within half an hour. We ended up so unhealthily attached,” she says. “And it ended up in us not having a lot in our lives but each other.” </p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="A couple living together" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/02/03122510/couple-living-together-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Maskot on Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sophie Thomas, Channel 4’s <a href="https://sophiethomas.love/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Love Guru and relationship coach</a>, advises that the best thing to do is to find a compromise between codependency and operating completely separately. “Healthy relationships are built on interdependence, rather than being totally independent or codependent,” says Thomas. “This means being supportive and encouraging to one another whilst taking responsibility for our own happiness, rather than transferring it on to our partner.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>In spite of the romance that surrounds a decision to move in together, the importance of being realistic and open to both changes and obstacles remains paramount. It’s not all morning sex and candlelit dinners, after all.</p>
<p>So within your parameters of domestic bliss, be sure that you are making space for the mundanity – and sometimes ugliness – of the world outside, including disagreements, domestic tasks and the importance of respecting personal space. And through it all, communication remains the best way of ensuring these issues don’t spiral out of control.</p>
<p>“Think about your relationship as if it’s a business deal – or from a kind of a professional point of view,” Mansfield recommends. “Think of it as having meetings about how you’re going to do things, who’s doing what, and what the outcomes and expectations are.</p>
<p>“You’re constantly working together as a team, constantly measuring, talking openly about success and failure in the relationship.”</p>
<p>It might not be the sexiest ‘moving in’ mantra to live by, but talking through every stage and every need you might have throughout the process is the best way to establish the right boundaries and create the cohabitation situation you want. Valuing the perceived mundanity of routine and communication as highly as the whimsy of romance is absolutely key. </p>
<p>“Communication and routine are equally as important as romance,” Dr Ben-Ari insists. “We need romance to spice things up, to bring energy to the relationship, and we need communication for safety, emotional intimacy and closeness.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re going to go out on a limb and say that nobody, not one person, who watched <i>The Hunger Games </i>or <i>Battle Royale </i>sat back and thought to themselves: ‘Hey, that looked <i>fun. </i>I wish I, too, could partake in a terrifying fight-to-the-death scenario like that.’</p>
<p>It seems the same cannot be said, however, for viewers of<i> <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/tv/squid-game-netflix-finale/571861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Squid Game</a></i>. On the surface, the smash-hit <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/tv/best-k-dramas-netflix/546543" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean drama</a> was all cutesy fun, as<i>&nbsp;</i>456 people came together to play traditional children’s games to win a huge cash prize. As is always the way with any huge cash prize, though, there’s a catch: to lose the game meant… well, it meant death, and usually a horribly violent death at that.</p>
<p>Despite all the candy-coloured gore, the series was hailed for its powerful commentary on socioeconomic divides, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and the desperation of the financially destitute in a never-ending cost of living crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, sure, it makes <i>total sense</i> that&nbsp;a new reality series will allow contestants to compete in the games from the OG show (minus the bloodbath) for a prize of $4.56 million (£3.7m).</p>
<p><b>Watch the trailer for<i> Squid Game: The Challenge </i>below:</b></p>
<p>Yup, it seems the deadly challenges in <i>Squid Game&nbsp;</i>– once a horrifying parallel of reality – have now been stripped of all meaning and allegory to be repackaged as a fun new game show. Go figure.</p>
<p>According to the Netflix synopsis: “456 real players will enter the competition show in pursuit of a life-changing reward of $4.56 million.</p>
<p>“As they compete through a series of games inspired by the original show – plus surprising new additions – their strategies, alliances and character will be put to the test while competitors are eliminated around them.”</p>
<p>While <i>Squid Game: The Challenge</i> absolutely and wholeheartedly misses the point of the OG series, that doesn’t mean the new series won’t be fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hell, even <i>Squid Game</i> director Hwang Dong-hyuk has urged people not to take the new reality series “too seriously”.</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>

<p>As per <i><a href="https://ew.com/tv/squid-game-creator-hwang-dong-hyuk-addresses-netflix-reality-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a></i>, Hwang acknowledged the concerns people had raised over the reality series being recreated as a competition, noting simply: “I feel like whenever you take things too seriously, that’s really not the best way to go for the entertainment industry. Doesn’t really set a great precedent.”</p>
<p>He also expressed a hope that the reality show’s creators “will be carrying on my vision and intention as much as possible for the show”.</p>
<p>Let’s wait and see what the darkest reality show ever made has in store for us, we guess…</p>
<p><b><i>Squid Game: The Challenge</i> will become available for streaming on Wednesday 22 November.&nbsp;</b></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/vanessa-kirby" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanessa Kirby</a> is one of those stars that shines bright no matter what she’s working on, but there’s no denying that she’s at her very best when she’s at the centre of a sumptuous period drama.</p>
<p>From <i>Great Expectations</i> to Agatha Christie’s <i>Poirot</i>, the talented actor has dazzled us many times over, though perhaps never more so than her award-winning portrayal of Princess Margaret in <i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/the-crown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Crown</a></i>. </p>
<p>Now, Kirby is about to win our hearts all over again with her latest project, <i>Napoleon</i>. Which, whatever the title may lead you to think, promises to be a story of love and loss in epic proportions.</p>
<p><b>Watch the trailer for <i>Napoleon </i>below:</b></p>
<p>Anyone with an A-level in French history will know the rough beats of Napoleon’s meteoric rise to fame. And, of course, anyone who remembers the contents of <i>that</i> love letter after its unexpected appearance in the first <i>Sex And The City</i> movie will know that the military leader and emperor was also half of one of the most famous, most volatile and most complex romances ever documented.</p>
<p>Now, <i>Napoleon</i>, a sweeping historical epic by Ridley Scott, promises to explore its subject through the prism of his relationship with his wife and one true love, Joséphine.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know.</p>
<h3>What is <i>Napoleon </i>about?</h3>
<p>It’s an origin story, documenting Napoleon’s swift and ruthless climb to emperor. The film takes us rocketing back in time to the days when Napoleon was a poor, insignificant army officer and Joséphine was a widow. They met by chance in a Paris ravaged by revolution, fell in love, married and… well, to say much more would likely take us into spoiler territory.</p>
<p class="">Let’s just add that there’s a reason why Napoleon and Joséphine’s relationship continues to be pored over by scholars and romantic souls alike.</p>
<h3>Who stars in <i>Napoleon</i>?</h3>
<p>The aforementioned Kirby takes on the complex role of Joséphine in this one, while Joaquin Phoenix stars opposite her as the eponymous Napoleon.</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Apple TV+</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>They are joined by the likes of Tahar Rahim, Mark Bonnar, Rupert Everett and Youssef Kerkour.
	  </p>
<h3>What are people saying about <i>Napoleon</i>?</h3>
<p>During a recent interview with <i><a href="https://collider.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a></i>, Kirby piled praise on Scott’s movie, noting: “It’s epic. Joaquin is extraordinary. It’s Ridley’s finest historical biopic, really. It’s got incredible battles and an amazing character study, like Joaquin does. It was a pleasure. It was a pleasure to do it. I loved it.”</p>
<p>The actor, who has been dubbed the scene-stealer of the grandiose film, added to <i><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/napoleon-uk-premiere-ridley-scott-joaquin-phoenix-vanessa-kirby-1235651738/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i>: “As with any fictional interpretation, who they are on screen and compared to the history, there’s always creative license. </p>
<p>“It’s like in <i>The Crown</i>. I learned that behind closed doors, it’s an imagined version of events… I read every book I possibly could about her to capture this very elusive, interesting, strange energy [that Joséphine] had.”</p>
<h3>When and where can we watch <i>Napoleon</i>?</h3>
<p><i>Napoleon </i>will be released in UK cinemas on Wednesday 22 November. The film will later arrive on Apple TV+ at an as-yet unannounced date.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve always been a planner; I have <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/to-do-list-alternatives-organisation/782579" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to-do lists</a> for nearly every aspect of my life. On a bigger scale, I have a vision for how I want my life to pan out. At least I did three years ago: dream job at 25; homeowner at 28; married at 30. But then Covid-19 hit in 2020, and all those plans were pushed to the back of my mind. </p>
<p>I can’t be the only one who feels like I’m now battling a two-year lag on my <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/work-boundaries-how-to-deal-with-boss-messaging-outside-working-hours/841213" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">career</a>, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/dating-love/best-questions-to-ask-on-a-first-date/824196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">love life</a> and health. I’m not as far forward in my career as I thought I’d be by now, and I’m no closer to home ownership or marriage than I was three years ago; if anything, I’m even further away. The cost of living crisis has reduced any hopes of saving for a house deposit and a recent breakup means I’ve re-joined the single life. On top of everything else, at 29, I’m now more aware than I’ve ever been of my own health and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/fertility-anxiety-facts/822594" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fertility</a>. </p>
<p>Writer Katy Schneider called it the ‘pandemic skip’ in a <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/post-covid-pandemic-age-essay.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 2023 article</a> for <i>The Cut,</i> and as soon as I came across the term, my lingering feeling of being left behind made a lot more sense. In the piece, Schneider describes it as “the strange sensation that our bodies might be a step out of sync with our minds”. That sounds about right to me, considering our lives were put on hold for two years while our bodies continued to get older.</p>
<p>Georgia, a 28-year-old marketing manager, calls it her “pause”. “My head is stuck in this strange limbo where I still <i>feel </i>26, so I want to go out partying, travel the world and be carefree, but everyone around me has settled down and moved on,” she explains. Georgia has noticed that many of her friends of a similar age have entered the next stage of their lives – moving in with partners, getting married and having kids. “My pandemic skip definitely feels as though I’ve been left behind.” </p>
<p>Lizzie, 28, who works in technology and operations, has also noticed an impact on her friendships. “It’s like I’ve been catapulted into an older and more settled life,” she says. “Before the pandemic, I used to love going out at the weekend and seeing friends as much as possible, but it all feels a lot harder now we’re in our late 20s.” </p>
<p>So, what has the pandemic skip<i> </i>done to our brains? According to psychotherapist Belynder Walia, the prolonged stress of so much uncertainty during those two years has had a significant impact on key areas of our brains responsible for memory, emotional regulation, decision-making and problem-solving “contributing to the feeling of being out of sync”.</p>
<p>Dr Rina Bajaj, a psychologist, also explains that due to the uncertainty of the pandemic, the prefrontal cortex of the brain (responsible for complex decision-making) “struggled to cope with the constant ambiguity” while we were also deprived of the positive effects that socialising can have on our brain. “We are now going through a process of resetting our brains and adjusting to a new landscape.”</p></p>

<h4>It’s OK not to have everything figured out</h4>

<p>It’s no surprise that women are likely to feel the pandemic skip most keenly, with increased caregiving responsibilities during the pandemic and having experienced the most economic and job insecurity. “This unequal burden has translated into heightened stress levels, anxiety and, in some cases, burnout for many women,” says Dr Bajaj.</p>
<p>However, there are some things we can do to help our minds catch up with our bodies and reduce the weight of pandemic skip. Dr Bajaj says we should start by acknowledging the unique challenges we’ve all faced and validate those feelings, understanding “that it’s OK not to have everything figured out”.</p>
<p>She suggests creating a consistent daily routine to provide structure and stability to “help to regain a sense of control in your life”, including physical activity and sleep to help reduce and manage stress. Dr Bajaj says that breaking down larger goals into smaller, achievable tasks can also help us feel less overwhelmed. “Remember to celebrate the smaller victories,” she adds.</p>
<p>More than three years since the beginning of the pandemic, I’m still very much feeling the effects of our collective two-year pause. I feel as though I’m falling behind friends who are getting engaged, buying their first homes and achieving much-deserved promotions; meanwhile, it feels as though my life has only just picked up speed again. And I can’t help but compare my life to theirs. But, instead of focusing on Instagram posts, one thing I have been trying to do is focus on what I can control. There are some things in my life I simply can’t force, speed up with shortcuts or manifest into existence, such as a partner or fast-forwarding my career by five years. Instead, I’m going to celebrate the smaller milestones when they come along, starting with moving out of my parents’ house to start life in a new city this year.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s no small feat to establish a film franchise based on a book that is already treasured by millions. Back in 2008, director Catherine Hardwicke revolutionised the young adult fantasy genre with&nbsp;<i>Twilight</i>. </p>
<p>From her edgy debut&nbsp;in 2003 with <i>Thirteen</i>, Hardwicke went on to release&nbsp;<i>Lords of Dogtown</i>, her chronicle of the 70s skateboarding scene, before her new Toni Colette-driven dark comedy,&nbsp;<i><a href="https://youtu.be/P2xwqQmBnsI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mafia Mamma</a></i>. It’s a surprise to Hardwicke that the teen vampire romance became her most influential and commercial success.</p>
<p>Stephanie Meyer’s novel spoke to countless teen hearts and preyed on our endless desire for unconventional love story. The moment that Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) clocks handsome, aloof Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) in the school cafeteria, neither of them stands a chance. So begins the genre-defining romance, which paved the way for future female-led fantasy franchises such as <i>The Hunger Games</i> and <i>Divergent</i>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though 15 years have passed since the film’s debut, Hardwicke recalls the experience with such energetic clarity and fondness that you’d be forgiven for thinking filming ended days, not years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What a crazy phenomenon,” Hardwicke says, shaking her head as though still in awe of it’s success. “When I took the job, we did not know that it was going to be this big global, worldwide hit. It was just mind-blowing.”</p>
<p>When asked about <i>Twilight</i>’s timeless appeal and cross-generational relevance - including its newfound following on TikTok - Hardwicke says it boils down to our innate desire to be loved or the allure of “a dangerous, forbidden romance.” </p>
<p>Ingrained within the film is the addictive nature of their desire, as Edward’s hunger for Bella grows and their dangerous obsession with each other parallels the animalistic anomaly of a “lion falling in love with a lamb”. Naturally, this only makes him want her more. </p>
<p>“Rob and Kristen have so much powerful chemistry in the movie that you feel like you’re there,” she adds, “It’s something that Stephanie Meyer was great about putting it in the DNA of the book - their longing.”</p>
<p>To evoke that in the film, Hardwicke mapped the lovers’ proximity in every frame to build that vital sexual tension. “I had a chart to mark exactly how close they ever got – like, if a finger touched, or if a hand touched,” she says, “I knew exactly what happened and calibrated every moment. It kind of teases you through the film.” </p>
<p>Alongside the epic love story, <i>Twilight</i> is widely recognised for its iconic, melancholic, muted aesthetic, where all the warmth and colour seems to have been drained out. Bella’s world is every sad girl’s daydream. </p>

</figure>
<p>Visually, it also illustrated the overcast location of Forks, which is integral to the book, as it’s one of the “foggiest and rainiest places in the whole continent” - a perfect retreat for vampires who sparkle in the sunlight. </p>
<p>Every directorial decision was made with a conscious effort to control the colour palette, from the filming schedule being weather-dependent, down to every minute wardrobe detail. The actors were intentionally styled in neutral, natural, earthy tones to mirror the wild landscape.</p>
<p>“If we were filming and the sun came out, we did not shoot,” Hardwicke said, “We’d have to go and build a little rain cave and shoot in there or there was an interior set that we could go to, like a cover set.”</p>
<p>Alongside the climate restrictions, their limited budget of $37 million (£32m) impacted the scope of Hardwicke’s vision for the film. “I wanted to shoot in the real Forks and La Push Beach, but we couldn’t afford that,” she says,  “I also wanted to do this really neat underwater sequence, more of the ballet sequence, more action, but we could only afford this much… and it worked.”</p>
<p>Studios were sceptical about a <i>Twilight</i> adaptation (“Nobody wanted to make it!”), but Hardwicke was dedicated to transforming Meyer’s cherished story it into a captivating big-screen experience. </p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Giles Bensimon</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>“<i>Twilight </i>was still growing in popularity as we made the film. We could read the comments online, search what scenes (like the meadow) or lines people loved and even had tattooed on their arms! We knew we had to get those right,” she reflects. </p>
<p>Reading is often an intangible, private experience at odds with the collective experience of cinema. It was important to Hardwicke that <i>Twilight</i> honoured the original story for the passionate existing fanbase. </p>
<p>“I had to take scenes that were beloved in the book – for example when Bella asks Edward, ‘How long have you been 17?’ and change it,” Hardwicke explains. “It was set in a car, and two people in a car, wearing a seatbelt, stuck in a seat is not the most cinematic visual. It’s quite boring. So I took it out and put it in the forest with this big techno crane swooping around. That way you feel the emotions too.”</p>
<p>She focused on creating a symbiotic relationship between the film and the novel, drawing out the themes and the essence of this epic-scale <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>-style love story in just over 120 minutes.  </p>
<p>“The treetop sequence in <i>Twilight</i> is not in the book at all. But it’s all about how it feels,” she says, “What it’s like to be in love with this cool vampire, who is dangerous and fast? Let’s make a scene that feels like that.”</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Those creative risks paid off at the box office, as <i>Twilight </i>made a staggering $407 million worldwide, making Hardwicke one of the most successful female directors of all time. Its monumental financial success left the ambitious director hopeful for the future of her filmmaking career.</p>
<p>“I immediately thought, ‘I’m going to get to do anything I want after this’. But that wasn’t the case,” she recollects. “At the time, people weren’t shining a light on female directors, so all the other <i>Twilight</i> movies were directed by men. The <i>Hunger Games</i> movies were directed by men, and <i>Divergent</i> too.”</p>
<p>Despite her passion for the <i>Twilight</i> franchise<i>,</i> Hardwicke chose to not return for the sequels, to focus on developing her original films. However, if she had returned, Hardwicke says she would have done things differently. </p>
<p>“I try to make a film in a personal way and I think they got less personal,” she says of the subsequent four installments, “I would have stayed with the tone that we created in the first film, where you’re more intimate with the characters.”</p>
<p>After Meyer published 2020’s <i>Midnight Sun</i>, a re-telling of the Twilight story from Edward’s perspective, it seems the <i>Twilight</i> universe may return to the big-screen in the future – and Hardwicke doesn’t rule out revisiting the franchise.</p>
<p>“Sure – I love it still,” she says, before offering a curveball for a new direction for the franchise. “I’d love to do it in outer space. That would be awesome.”</p>
<p>“I’d love to do something with it. I’m not against it, as I’m very interested in cool stories like <i>Twilight </i>and creating another world. I’m open to anything.”</p>
<p>For now, though, Hardwicke is at the helm of a new female-led dark comedy, <i>Mafia Mamma</i>. Each of her films might be “quite different” but the focus remains the same - to “just live in somebody else’s skin for a while”. </p>
<p>“I thought [<i>Mafia Mamma</i>] was kind of great,” she says, “This woman has been silenced and ignored. Her husband doesn’t really care about her, her son is ready to go away to college and her bosses are toxic men who don’t respect her voice. So the fact that she finally finds her voice as the film progresses is exciting.”</p>
<p>“We were also still filming during the pandemic, and I knew I wanted Toni Collette and for the film to be a fun, female empowerment story about a woman finding her voice and some cool revenge in there too.”</p>
<p><b><i>Mafia Mamma</i> is available to stream on Prime Video from November 17. </b></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that we’re edging ever closer to winter, it feels like our time is constantly spent <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/why-everyone-is-sick-now-science/839486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dodging other people’s colds</a> and fighting against the urge to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/bed-rot-trend-tiktok/799532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stay in bed</a>. And it’s now that maintaining a healthy gut – essential for helping us cope with these seasonal health woes – can feel like a bit of a slog. </p>
</p>
<p>Getting up in the dark, sitting under artificial light all day and coming home in the dark (rinse and repeat until March) means there’s barely a sliver of natural daylight to be savoured. It’s this simple fact that could be why you’re feeling off-kilter. </p>
</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/a-new-intervention-study-from-canadian-researchers-is-the-first-to-find-changes-in-the-human-gut-microbiota-in-response-to-uvb-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small pilot study</a> by the University of British Columbia and the Women’s Health Research Institute in Vancouver, Canada, discovered that exposure to UVB light (naturally encountered via sunlight) may lead to beneficial changes in the gut microbiome. It’s the first time this link has been found.  </p>
<p>For the study, one group of women took vitamin D supplements over three months in winter, while a second group didn’t. Then, both groups were exposed to three full-body UVB light sessions over a week. Researchers found that following UVB exposure, levels of vitamin D had increased in both groups by an average of around 10%. However, those with lower initial vitamin D levels recorded a greater increase following the UVB sessions. </p>
</p>
<p>Interestingly, the study found that repeated skin exposure to UVB light increased the diversity in the gut microbiota of the group who had not taken vitamin D supplements, raising it to the same level as the group who had taken supplements.</p></p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Woman at dark windows" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/14151156/gettyimages-1447752086-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This may be a small study, but it has piqued the interest of the gut health community with experts, including those at <a href="https://zoe.com/learn/the-gut-skin-axis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoe</a>, who are heralding it as a gateway to exploring the link between UVB light and the gut microbiota. A growing body of research is now joining the dots between gut diversity and sunlight via UVB effects on the skin microbiome. </p>
<p>This better understanding of the ‘gut-skin axis’ – ie how changes in the skin microbiome may be reflected in the gut microbiome, and vice versa – helps explain why some conditions appear simultaneously. People living with coeliac disease or inflammatory bowel disease  may also suffer from psoriasis, for example. 
	  </p>
<h2><\h2><p>Given that we enjoy fewer daylight hours during the winter, does that mean our gut health is more at risk right now? And if so, do we need to tweak our gut health routine to make up for the lack of naturally produced vitamin D?</p>
</p>
<p>Orla Stone, dietitian, nutritionist and gut health specialist at <a href="https://www.deeplyfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deeply</a>, explains that winter presents specific challenges for our <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/gut-health-improvements/667430" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gut health</a>, which low levels of vitamin D will exacerbate further. </p>
<p>“In the colder months, constipation and bloating can be more of a problem,” she tells <i>Strong Women</i>. “This is down to the fact that people tend to move less and drink less water, both of which are important for keeping your gut moving well.</p>
<p>“If your body’s inner temperature drops, your digestion will slow down, so keeping warm is key for maintaining healthy digestion.” </p></p>

<p>We may also gravitate towards certain foods. “Dark, cold days can encourage comfort eating and snacking on processed foods which, in turn, will reduce your intake of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/how-to-get-more-fibre-diet/523515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nutritious fibre-rich foods</a> that help your gut bacteria to thrive. [This supports] many different aspects of your health, such as mood and immunity, both of which can be challenged over the winter months,” explains Stone. </p>
</p>
<p>We’re also ducking and diving our way along the obstacle course of coughs and colds. “Given that 70% of our immune cells reside in our gut, keeping our gut healthy in winter is so important for helping to deal with any infections,” says Stone.  </p>
</p>
<p>“One particular nutrient that you need to focus on over these darker months is vitamin D, which appears to have positive effects on your gut microbiome and your immune system.” </p>
<h2><\h2><h3>Eat more natural sources of vitamin D</h3>
</p>
<p>“Both vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 raise your blood vitamin D levels; however, vitamin D3 has been shown to be slightly better,” explains Stone. “Vitamin D3 is found naturally in foods such as egg yolks, oily fish (including salmon, mackerel and sardines), red meat and liver.  </p>
</p>
<p>“Fortified sources use vitamin D2 and include some spreads, cereals, plant milks and yoghurts, and these can be useful for those who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet.” </p>
</p>
<p>Winter is also tailor-made for gut-friendly food choices. Soup and stew season makes it easier to fill your diet with 30 different plants a week, along with cold-weather favourites such dark chocolate and warming spices including cinnamon and ginger. </p></p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Take vitamin D supplements </h3>
</p>
<p>“It’s very difficult to get sufficient vitamin D from food alone. Therefore, it’s recommended you take a supplement providing 10mcg (400IU) of vitamin D3 daily from October to the end of March,” says Stone. She points out that vitamin D3 can also be sourced from algae, so vegetarians and vegans can top up their levels with an appropriate supplement. </p>
</p>
<p>“Vitamin D is fat soluble so it’s best to take it alongside a meal containing some fat so that it’s easier for the body to absorb it,” she adds. </p>
</p>
<p>Dr Ross Perry, a GP and medical director of <a href="https://info.cosmedics.co.uk/?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA0syqBhBxEiwAeNx9N3d9tgkRPxw9AAtRWYP-q5JminKok6kStnUKmt4Boda86WryoptO3xoCs2oQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmedics</a> skin clinics, adds: “If we’re getting vitamin D naturally from the sun, we’re synthesising it during the day. [Therefore] supplements are better taken in the morning.” </p>
<h2><\h2><h3>Going outside in natural daylight </h3>
</p>
<p>Dr Perry says: “We get most of our <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/vitamin-d-deficiency-symptoms-signs-immune-system-fatigue/403575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vitamin D</a> from sunlight exposure around late March to the end of September. However, in winter, sunlight doesn’t contain enough UVB radiation for our skin to be able to make enough vitamin D, so we need to get this from food and supplements.” </p>
</p>
<p>A stroll around the park may not boost your vitamin D but it’s still a vital part of remaining healthy and happy in winter. Stone says: “There’s a bi-directional relationship between your gut bacteria and your sleep – the health of both is related to each other. Getting out for a walk in the morning light helps you feel more alert because it suppresses melatonin, the hormone that makes you feel sleepy, and stabilises your circadian rhythm so you fall asleep at the correct time and wake up less often.” </p>
</p>
<h3>Using a sunbed </h3>
</p>
<p>Google ‘Do sunbeds give you vitamin D?’ and you’ll be faced with pages of conflicting information. Yes, sunbeds do emit UV rays but, as highlighted by <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/sun-uv-and-cancer/how-do-sunbeds-cause-skin-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cancer Research UK</a>, the amount of vitamin D you gain is far outweighed by the risks of UV damage and skin cancer. </p>
<h3>Switching on a SAD lamp </h3>
</p>
<p>Surely your trusty <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/sad-lamp-review-lumie/594170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAD lamp</a> can do the same job as the missing sunshine, right? Wrong.  </p>
</p>
<p>SAD lamps don’t emit the all-important UVB light needed for vitamin D production. They’re designed to mimic sunlight and filter out harmful UV rays, which is why you don’t need to wear sunscreen when using one.  </p>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder-sad/treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the NHS</a>, there is mixed evidence that light therapy works, but it does add that some studies have found SAD lamps, particularly if used in the morning, can help <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/how-to-fix-circadian-rhythm/631378" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regulate your circadian rhythms</a> and boost serotonin which lifts mood and reduces stress. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it’s dark, cold and wet outside, the last thing most of us want to do is head out for a run or walk.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the winter months often give those of us looking to keep up an exercise routine little choice – between week-long storm fronts and temperature dips, the weather at this time of year can be relentless. If you’re training for a big event or just want to keep your fitness levels up, that can leave you with few options but to grin and bear it.</p>
<p>But the last thing you want to do is spend the next three months feeling miserable every time you lace up your running shoes or look out the window. Winter tends to drag on, and it can be hard to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/winter-workout-exercise-routine-motivation/574047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stick to an exercise routine</a> that makes you groan with dread every time you think about it. </p>
<p>So, to help you navigate this conundrum, we asked a group of fitness experts for the top tips they swear by to make outdoor winter exercise enjoyable. Here’s what they had to say. </p>
<h2><\h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>

<p>During spring and summer, you can get away with exercising in any old pair of shorts and T-shirt (as long as you’ve got <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/women-wrong-sports-bras/812291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a good sports bra</a>). However, as the weather gets colder, you’ll need <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/shopping/winter-running-gear/448426" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kit that will help to keep you warm</a> and allow you to perform at your best.</p>
<p>“Kit is particularly important when it comes to staying motivated over the colder months,” explains David Wiener, a personal trainer from the fitness coaching app <a href="https://www.freeletics.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freeletics</a>. “Investing in high-quality cold-weather workout gear can make a significant difference: look for moisture-wicking, thermal and windproof clothing to keep you warm and dry.” </p>
<p>Wearing lots of layers will also allow you to stay comfortable throughout your workout as you warm up. “Layering also ensures adaptability in unpredictable weather conditions,” adds Adam Byrne, clinical fitness regional lead at <a href="https://www.nuffieldhealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nuffield Health</a>. Byrne recommends putting together an outfit consisting of three key layers: a moisture-wicking material, an insulating layer and a water and windproof outer layer.</p>
<p>“If it suddenly brightens up, you can take that insulative middle layer off and go with a T-shirt and jacket combination,” he says. “Ensure you’re opting for lightweight garments where possible to make carrying them easier.”
	  </p>
<h2><\h2><p>Cold weather makes your muscles extra stiff, so warming up is a must to protect yourself from injury. If you struggle with the transition from indoors to outdoors, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/autumn-winter-warm-up-cold-weather/830980" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warming up inside</a> (in your kit) before heading out can make things feel less jarring.  </p>
<p>If you’re running, make sure to pay particular attention to your leg muscles – <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/pre-workout-stretches-warm-up-exercises/425347#:~:text=Lying%20on%20your%20front%20with,be%20overarching%20through%20the%20back." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dynamic stretching</a>, jogging on the spot and a few star jumps will all help. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>When the temperatures get really low, you might find the cold air can cause a bit of discomfort in your chest; the cold air hitting the respiratory system can cause feelings of tightness and irritation. However, there are steps you can take to prevent this, Byrne says. </p>
<p>Some things he recommends trying include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Breathing through your nose instead of your mouth </li>
<li>Wearing a scarf or snood </li>
<li>Focusing on slower, deeper breathing </li>
<li>Slowing down </li>
<li>Aiming for longer, not faster </li>
<li>Wearing a mask-type face covering </li>
</ul>

<p>If working out in the dark just isn’t your bag, then popping out during your lunch break could be a more realistic goal. Whether you’re WFH or in the office, heading out for a jog or walk around the block can make a real difference, says Sam Quinn, personal training lead at Nuffield Health.  </p>
<p>“Even 15 minutes can have a host of benefits for your physical and mental health,” he says. “It can also be an effective way of beating SAD, which can often make us struggle with energy and motivation. Employers can also play their part in encouraging colleagues to take a break to get active.” </p>
<p>Scheduling in your workout by <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/midday-workouts-meetings-hack/803611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blocking out time in your calendar</a> can help to ensure you take the time to get moving rather than getting distracted by an endless number of meetings (we’ve all been there). </p>
<h2><\h2><p>There will always be days when you can’t quite face the lashing rain and howling wind, and that’s OK. Being realistic about what’s achievable – and celebrating the wins – can help you to stay engaged even when things don’t go quite according to plan.  </p>
<p>“If you miss a workout, don’t let that derail your progress,” Wiener says. “Sometimes it will be simply too cold to work out outside or go for a walk, and that’s OK.” </p>
<h2><\h2><p><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/how-to-prioritise-exercise-fitness-goals/518067" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Setting goals</a> is motivation 101 – not only does it give you something to work towards, but it also means you can adopt a training plan or schedule that’ll help you monitor your progress. </p>
<p>A good place to start is ensuring your goals are specific, measured and achievable, Wiener explains. “Having a clear sense of what you want to achieve can keep you motivated, even when it’s cold outside,” he says. </p>
<p>Your goal doesn’t need to be something as big as running a marathon or doing 20,000 steps every day, either. Even a small goal – for example, improving your 5k time or trying to walk a certain distance over the course of the week – can help to keep you accountable and give you an extra reason for getting outside when you’d rather not.</p>
<h2><\h2><p>Convincing yourself to swap your warm, comfy bed for the wet and windy outside isn’t easy, so giving yourself some extra motivation in the form of community can be hugely helpful.</p>
<p>“You can buddy up with a friend or family member, join a team sport or become part of a run club,” explains Hugh Hanley, head of personal training at <a href="https://www.puregym.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PureGym</a>. “Everyone has a different exercise that they enjoy, and by finding what is right for you and making it social, you are more likely to stick to it throughout winter.”</p>
<p>You could also try making your exercise sessions into more of an event by tagging on a coffee or brunch to the end of your run or walk – not only will it serve as extra motivation, but it’s the perfect way to warm up after you’ve been out in the cold.m  </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re one of the <a href="https://howtosleep.co.uk/guides/sleep-statistics/#chapter-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22% of people in the UK</a> who has trouble getting to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sleep</a> every night, you’ve probably already tried a whole range of suggestions in your quest for <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quality shut-eye</a>. </p>
<p>We all know how important a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/sleep/live-longer-study/765275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good night’s sleep</a> is, impacting everything from our <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/easy-productivity-hacks-attention-span-focus/828160" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attention span</a> to our <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/fitness-and-wellbeing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">physical health</a>, so any methods of improving our sleep quality are always welcome. And it’ll come as no surprise that TikTok is responsible for many of the tips and tricks we are trying. </p>
<p>The latest phenomenon taking over the social media platform is a concept known as moon breathing. Also known as the moon piercing breath, or <i>chandra bhedana</i>, the yogic breathing technique is said to bring about a sense of calm and relaxation – making it ideal for pre-bedtime.</p>
<p>It has already garnered a huge number of likes, so it might be worth a try. But how does it work? Here’s everything you need to know. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>Moon breathing is a variation of alternate nostril breathing that focuses solely on the left nostril. It’s a form of pranayama or controlled yogic breathing and involves holding your right nostril shut while breathing in and out through the left. </p>
<p>“Moon breathing might sound a bit out there, but it can be a really useful tool for those struggling with sleep,” says Rosey Davidson, a sleep consultant and founder of <a href="https://justchillbabysleep.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Just Chill Baby Sleep</a>. “This practice focuses on consciously slowing down and deepening the breath, which engages our parasympathetic nervous system (responsible for rest and relaxation).”</p>
<p>But what’s it got to do with the moon? </p>
<p>The practice relates to the traditional Indian medicine theory of <i>nadis</i>, the body’s energy channels. The three principle nadis are <i>ida</i>, <i>pingala</i> and <i>sushuma</i>, with ida nadi being the channel located on the lefthand side of the body. <a href="https://www.estuaryyoga.com.au/blog-home/chandra-bhedana-moon-breath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This nadi is thought to have a moonlike nature and feminine energy</a>, which is why this form of left nostril breathing has been linked to the moon.</p>
<h2><\h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="illustration woman and moon - moon breathing and sleep" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/16111340/moon-breathing-2-1120x1120.jpg">

<p>We all know that <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/breathing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breathwork</a> is fantastic for promoting a sense of calm and alleviating stress, anxiety and tension in the body. Focusing on our breath encourages mindfulness, allowing us to let go of stress, unwind and (hopefully) fall asleep more easily. </p>
<p>“Nostril breathing can help to prevent snoring, and it improves the immune system as our nostrils warm, filter and moisten the air we’re taking in,” says wellness consultant <a href="https://www.serendipitywellness.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracy Richardson</a>. “Nasal breathing can also help with dry mouth and teeth grinding.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>While research into the particular benefits of left nostril breathing is limited, we know that mindful, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/immune-system-conscious-breathing/497034" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controlled breathing</a> can have a powerful impact on our parasympathetic nervous system, also known as the side of the nervous system responsible for the ‘rest and digest’ state. </p>
<p>“By reducing the flow of air through our nostrils, we are increasing the carbon dioxide levels in our body, allowing for improved oxygenation of our cells, while calming our nervous system ready for sleep,” explains Jane Tarrant, breathing habit retrainer and educator at <a href="https://www.linkbreathing.co.uk/breathing-retraining" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link Breathing</a>. </p>
<p>“By nose breathing, and even more so, single nostril breathing, we are increasing pressure to reach the bottom of our lungs, encouraging our diaphragm to stimulate our <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/vagus-nerve-exercises-stress-sleep/731965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vagus nerve</a>,” she continues. “The focus of this practice can also help calm racing thoughts through distraction and mindfulness.”
	  </p>
<h2><\h2><p>Luckily, moon breathing is one of TikTok’s more accessible trends. And <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9564237/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies</a> show that it really does work, so grab yourself a pillow and blanket, get comfy and follow these steps. </p>
<ol>
<li>Find a comfortable seated or lying position.</li>
<li>Bring your right hand close to your nose, keeping your elbow down. Inhale deeply through your nose, and count to four,  allowing your abdomen to expand.</li>
<li>Using your thumb, close your right nostril.</li>
<li>Then, exhale through your left nostril counting to six, contracting your abdomen.</li>
<li>Inhale through your left nostril. </li>
<li>Next, close your left nostril with your ring or pinky finger.</li>
<li>Exhale through the right nostril and inhale through your right nostril.</li>
<li>Using your thumb, close your right nostril. Exhale through your left nostril. Inhale through your left nostril.</li>
<li>You can also try alternating your breath between your nostrils – in through your left, out through your right, and vice versa, for around three minutes. </li>
</ol>
<h2><\h2><p>It’s not advisable if you’re congested or stuffy. </p>
<p>“Some people may try breathing through one nostril and find that they feel triggered to breathe more or it may result in a panicked, breathless or dizzy feeling after a few seconds or minutes,” warns Tarrant. “If this happens, you might wish to work on having optimal breathing habits during the day, gradually moving on to a night-time practice, or try another breathwork method.”</p>
<p>And even if it makes no difference to your sleep, moon breathing is a relaxing, calming end to your day, and we can’t ask for much more than that. </p>

<h2><\h2><p class="">With trusty tailoring and razor-sharp suiting, a neat blazer is an obvious choice for any corporate setting, but can still be sophisticated outside of office hours. The key here is to pay close attention to the silhouettes and the quality of construction. Whatever style you pick, from oversized relaxed to pressed and polished, you will soon find the blazer to be a true workhorse. </p>

<h2><\h2><p>Another perennial staple in the winter workwear category is the power dress. As the name suggests, they exude professionalism with high-impact, all thanks to their voluminous silhouette and pumped-up shoulders. This dramatic style will  get rid of the morning meltdown and help you look – and, more importantly, feel – great on the job. </p>
<p>Take inspiration from the latest crop of spring/summer 2024 collections and opt for draped and gathered styles à la Roksanda and Eudon Choi. Or think big (literally and figuratively) with 80s-inspired padded shoulders, to serve the ultimate power move this season. </p>

<h2><\h2><p>Comfortable and chic, you can always rely on wide-leg trouser for the office. Black is always a good option, but look beyond this classic tone and consider charcoal, burgundy and plaid styles. These will co-ordinate well with all your neutral basics, seeing you through each and every career-defining meeting and work dinner, but can also be styled again at the weekend too with a sleek white trainer and bomber jacket. </p>

<h2><\h2><p>Once you have your foundation pieces perfected, you can now up your footwear game. The best way to look cool yet decidedly work-appropriate is by incorporating a pair of loafers – they’re a classic preppy style. </p>
<p>And thanks to Prada who first debuted the coveted shoe in 2020, they’ve had a little upgrade and now reflect our wider relaxation of office life. The modern-day loafer is luxy, chunky and leather – a far cry from the sensible ones you wore on the school playground. Pick a pair with heavy hardware and lug-soles, to stomp through your busy commute with ease.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Across the internet and in our IRL interactions, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/narcissism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">narcissism</a> has become a buzzword. We <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/signs-of-narcissist-narcissism/819499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fling the label of ‘narcissist’ at bad exes</a> and look for <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/how-to-spot-the-narcissist-within-you/644198" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signs of narcissistic personality disorder</a> in our bosses, ticking off mental checklists and warning our friends to stay far, far away from anyone who shows a single narcissism-tinged flag. </p>
<p>What’s far less spoken about is the other half of relationships with a narcissistic partner: echoism. Often referred to as the opposite of narcissism, echoism is a collection of personality traits and behaviours that tend to be present in people who find themselves in partnerships with narcissists. </p>
<p>When an echoist meets a narcissist, things can go very, very wrong. So it’s important to know not only how to spot narcissism in others, but also how to notice echoism in ourselves. How do we do that? Let’s break it down. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>“Echoism is a rather poetic term that was coined in 2005, borrowing from Greek mythology, to refer to when a person has given up their own identity in service of another person’s,” Lisa Bruton, psychologist and <a href="https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/counsellors/lisa-bruton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Counselling Directory member</a>, tells <i>Stylist</i>. “Their whole being is oriented towards another person and they have completely lost touch with their own selves – their needs, wishes and wants. </p>
<p>“To be an echoist means you exist only in relationship to another and that you have yet to take possession of your voice– in the Greek myth it was Echo who lost the power of speech and was allowed only to echo the words of others.”</p>
<p>In short, if you’re an echoist, you’ll put other people’s needs and wants high above your own. Think of it as an extreme version of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/signs-youre-too-nice-people-pleasing/623242" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people-pleasing</a>, where your entire self gets lost in favour of someone else. </p>
<p>“Echoism, in psychological terms, refers to a personality style characterised by a strong tendency to prioritise others’ needs over one’s own, often at the expense of personal wellbeing,” notes Dr Martina Paglia of the <a href="https://theinternationalpsychologyclinic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Psychology Clinic</a>. “Echoists exhibit traits of extreme self-effacement, an intense desire to avoid attention or acknowledgement, and a deep discomfort in receiving praise or recognition.”</p>

<h2><\h2><p>Signs of echoism include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fearing praise</li>
<li>Fearing seeming selfish or narcissistic in any way</li>
<li>Excessively focusing on other people to the detriment of yourself</li>
<li>Neglecting your own needs</li>
<li>Struggling to create and maintain personal boundaries</li>
<li>Suppressing your own desires</li>
<li>Always agreeing with others</li>
<li>Avoiding or rejecting attention from others</li>
<li>Blaming yourself for everything </li>
<li>Being extremely self-critical</li>
<li>Struggling to assert yourself</li>
<li>Always needing to please others</li>
<li>Constantly making sacrifices for other people’s benefit</li>
<li>Never feeling good enough</li>
</ul>
<h2><\h2><p>As with so many things, you can blame your parents. Echoism often emerges from being raised by a parent with narcissistic tendencies. </p>
<p>“It is thought that echoism results from a toxic melange of a sensitive and attuned child, born into a household where one or all of the primary caregivers (typically the parents) have high narcissistic traits,” Bruton notes. “These caregivers exploit the child’s natural susceptibility to pay attention to the feelings of others, and set up a situation where to have their caregivers’ affection (crucial when you are young and highly dependent), the child needs to ‘feed’ the caregivers love of self and devote all their energies towards making the parent feel good and cared for. It is an example of reversed parenting (also known as <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/family-friends/what-is-emotional-parentification-how-to-heal/787974" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parentification</a>), where the child is doing for the parent what the parent should be doing for the child.”</p>
<p>Echoism is used as a way to try to ‘win’ attention and affection when it isn’t readily given. It can often be a sort of survival strategy – a way for someone to cope with an early relationship dynamic in which they didn’t feel secure. </p>

<h4>An echoist exists only in relationship to another</h4>

<h2><\h2><p>Going about your life always putting your needs and wants at the bottom of the priority pile is, as you might expect, not great. The mental health impact is significant and the self-sacrificial, self-suppressing traits of echoists can mean they make decisions that set their life on a path that doesn’t fulfil them in any way, shape or form. </p>
<p>“Echoism can impact day-to-day living in many ways,” Bruton says. “At its core, it is a lack of relationship to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/self-loss-meaning-how-it-manifests/826690" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Self, to yourself</a>. The internal dialogue of an echoist would typically be critical and self-abasing. They might shy away from anything that might bring them success, attention and praise. They might neglect their appearance and other aspects of adult functioning, such as pursuing career and financial goals, fitness goals, a rich social life. Basically, they have signed an unspoken pact that requires them to forgo any personal success if they want to be in relationship.” </p>
<p>“Echoism can impact daily life by causing difficulties in asserting one’s needs, neglecting self-care, fostering unhealthy relationships and contributing to stress, low self-esteem and communication challenges,” says researcher and relationship expert <a href="https://www.love-evolved.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limor Gottlieb</a>. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>Within the context of a relationship, echoism can cause a seriously toxic dynamic; especially if an echoist is paired with a narcissist. The problem is: echoists tend to be attracted to narcissists, and narcissists tend to be attracted to echoists. Oops. </p>
<p>“Echoists often find themselves in relationships with narcissists due to their tendency to put others’ needs above their own,” Paglia tells us. “This dynamic can be damaging because the narcissist’s self-centred behaviour further reinforces the echoist’s tendencies, creating an unhealthy cycle of dependency and imbalance.”</p>
<p>An echoist will want to give up everything to please their partner, while a narcissist will all too happily take, take, take. The end result is a narcissist is emboldened to ramp up their unhealthy behaviours, and an echoist is encouraged to continue suppressing themselves to let the narcissist shine. </p>
<p>Bruton explains: “The narcissist will exploit this excessive selflessness, and bleed the echoist dry of all their internal resources. Indeed in the myth, Echo stands by Narcissus until his death, at which point she turns to stone – a vivid metaphor to show that she had no internal ‘fire’ of her own.</p>
<p>“The echoist will find a natural ‘home’ with a narcissist, but this is in fact the unfortunate marriage of two dysfunctional positions. Rather than push back on the echoist’s excessive giving, the narcissist might in fact exploit and encourage it. The echoist is back in a very familiar role but one that leaves them empty and depleted, neglecting their own lives. From the outside it might seem like a perfect fit, but in fact neither party is learning to be in a relationship in a healthy way. </p>
<p>“The echoist is often very defensive of their partner, displaying the loyalty they might have felt as a child toward their parents. They are so out of touch with their own limits that they may not realise when they are tired from emotional caretaking, need to look after themselves more, and set boundaries, for instance.”</p>
<p>“Echoists prioritise the needs of narcissists, who seek admiration and validation. This imbalance can result in exploitative behaviour, a lack of reciprocity, self-neglect, low self-esteem, self-blame, cycles of abuse, isolation, and difficulties in leaving the relationship,” Gottlieb adds. </p>

<h2><\h2><p>“If one recognises signs of echoism in themselves or their partner, it’s crucial to seek therapy or counselling to address underlying issues,” Paglia shares. “Working on building self-esteem, setting boundaries and learning assertiveness skills can significantly help in dealing with echoism. Both individual and couples therapy can be beneficial to navigate these challenges and establish healthier relationship dynamics.”</p>
<p>Echoist traits aren’t something to brush under the rug. You also shouldn’t assume that this is ‘just the way you are’ or think that you can continue in a relationship with a narcissist without making any changes – this isn’t healthy, and it’s a route not only to unhappy relationships but an unfulfilling life packed with self-doubt and constant questions about who you really are. </p>
<p>“Recognising and addressing echoistic tendencies is crucial for personal growth, self-esteem and building healthier relationships,” says Gottlieb. “Therapy and professional guidance can be valuable tools in the journey to achieve a more balanced and fulfilling life.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fashion can be a secretive and mysterious old world, especially for those of us not privy to the inner workings of the industry. Although mostly works of fiction, TV shows and films such as <i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/devil-wears-prada-career-lessons/799997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Devil Wears Prada</a></i>, <i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/house-of-gucci-fashion-lady-gaga/550713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">House Of Gucci</a> </i>and <i>The Assassination Of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story</i> help to shed a little more light on what goes on behind the scenes of the fashion world.

<p>Sharing the first glimpses of its new drama series <i>The New Look</i>, Apple TV+ will be debuting the 10-episode series early next year. Inspired by true events, the historical drama focuses on the stories of fashion designers Christian Dior, Coco Chanel and their contemporaries as they navigated the horrors of the Second World War and launched modern fashion as we know it today.</p>
<p>Here’s everything we know so far about <i>The New Look</i>.</p>
<h3><b>What is the plot of <i>The New Look</i>?</b></h3>
<p>Inspired by true events and filmed exclusively in one of the fashion capitals of the world, <i>The New Look</i> is set against the Nazi occupation of Paris during the Second World War and focuses on the “pivotal moment in the 20th century when the French city led the world back to life through its fashion icon Christian Dior”.</p>
<p>The official synopsis continues: “As Dior rises to prominence with his groundbreaking, iconic imprint of beauty and influence, Chanel’s reign as the world’s most famous fashion designer is put into jeopardy. The interwoven saga follows the surprising stories of Dior’s contemporaries and rivals from Chanel to Pierre Balmain, Cristóbal Balenciaga and more; and provides a stunning view into the atelier, designs and clothing created by Christian Dior through collaboration with the House of Dior.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“It’s just how some people react to people like us,” my mother told me when I was around eight years old, in response to me asking her why a strange man on the bus home from school was shouting at her. My mum wears a hijab – a headscarf – so she’s visibly a Muslim woman and has been subjected to her fair share of verbal abuse since my parents moved to the UK in the early 1990s. But how do you explain this to an eight-year-old who doesn’t understand why a person who’s never encountered us before suddenly decides to hurl abuse at a stranger on a bus? Sadly, this wouldn’t be the last time I came across what is now referred to as Islamophobia.</p>
<p>The term Islamophobia first appeared in public policy discourse in 1997, but it’s still not officially defined by the UK government. It was only relatively recently, in 2017, that a definition of Islamophobia was put forward by an all-party parliamentary group (APPG) but the Conservative party <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/islamophobia-definition-conservative-government-michael-gove-b2213075.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropped its plans</a> to give Islamophobia an official definition. But even without a state definition, it’s a type of racism that’s understood to target expressions of Islam or perceived Muslimness. And it’s on the rise.</p>
<p>As of March 2023, where the perceived religion of the victim was recorded, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hate-crime-england-and-wales-2022-to-2023/hate-crime-england-and-wales-2022-to-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two in five (44%) of all religious hate crime offences were targeted against Muslims</a> – making Muslims the most targeted faith group in the UK. But it’s certainly not new. In August 2018, having recently resigned as foreign secretary, Boris Johnson wrote a column for <i>The Telegraph</i> in which he compared women in niqabs to “looking like letterboxes”, which led to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/02/boris-johnsons-burqa-comments-led-to-surge-in-anti-muslim-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">375% increase in Islamophobia incidents the week after the article was published</a>.</p>
<p>But one thing Islamophobia is not is a ‘phobia’, despite its name. One of the most common things I’ve heard over the years when it comes to this form of prejudice is “But it’s not really racism, is it?” There are still misconceptions surrounding it. Islamophobia isn’t based on individual fear or apprehension, even though many people can regard it in this way. And when it’s understood in this context, it minimises the experiences of Muslims and frames this form of racism as a lesser version of hate and prejudice.</p>
<p>It can also imply that because of this fear, people have no control over their beliefs or behaviour, normalising Islamophobia and removing any type of accountability.</p>
<p>With this normalisation comes very real consequences for Muslim communities – from experiencing abuse and violence to dealing with prejudice and discrimination in the workplace. According to a <a href="https://hyphenonline.com/2022/06/07/exclusive-more-than-two-thirds-of-uk-muslims-have-experienced-islamophobia-in-the-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Savanta ComRes survey</a>, which asked 1,500 UK Muslims about their work and careers, seven out of 10 said they had encountered Islamophobia in a range of work scenarios, including engaging with customers or clients (44%) and at work-related social events (42%).</p>
<p>Another survey conducted by the University of Birmingham and YouGov in 2022 found that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/middle-class-britons-more-likely-to-be-biased-about-islam-finds-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">British public is almost three times more likely</a> to hold prejudiced views of Islam than they are of other religions. Muslims are also the UK’s second “least liked” group with 25.9% of people surveyed feeling negatively towards Muslim communities.</p>
<p>It’s why it’s more important than ever that Islamophobia is properly understood for what it is: a structural form of racism that targets a specific group of people for the simple act of practising a faith. And it shouldn’t fall on Muslims to constantly call out and stand against Islamophobia because we can’t push back on this normalisation without people outside of our communities also taking a stand with us. </p>
<ul>
<li>A good starting point for accessing more resources is the official <a href="https://www.islamophobia-awareness.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Islamophobia Awareness Month website</a> which contains a range of information packs that you can easily download and access dependent on the context – if it’s your school, university or workplace.</li>
<li>The not-for-profit MEND (Muslim Engagement and Development) also has <a href="https://www.mend.org.uk/resources-and-publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several resources and publications</a> available to read, which includes guides, factsheets and toolkits.</li>
<li>It’s also worth engaging with prominent Muslim voices and their work – from books such as <i><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/cut-from-the-same-cloth-muslim-women-on-life-in-britain-sabeena-akhtar/5030015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cut From The Same Cloth</a></i> and <i><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/it-s-not-about-the-burqa-muslim-women-on-faith-feminism-sexuality-and-race-mariam-khan/1401247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It’s Not About The Burqa</a></i> to publications like <i><a href="https://www.amaliah.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amaliah</a>.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever I encounter an Islamophobic comment or abusive behaviour, one thing I wish non-Muslims would do is call it out. It can be exhausting work for Muslims and our collective voices are always stronger together. In the end, solidarity is action and not just words.</p></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cream <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/bronzer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bronzer</a> is up there with the most divisive of beauty products. Even those who are devout users of powder formulas can’t always be swayed to the dark side, but once a convert, there’s no going back.</p>
<p>Choose the right product, apply it with the right tool and you’ve got the perfect way to help perk up your face that’ll give you a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/highlighter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthy-looking glow</a> with minimal effort required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carefully buffed onto cheekbones and temples, perhaps even across the nose for good measure, cream bronzer melts into the skin and provides a supremely natural finish that adds a luminosity that you wouldn’t be able to achieve with a powder bronzer. </p>
<p>But, we get it, knowing which cream bronzer is best isn’t always easy. You want something that’s going to complement your skin tone in a subtle way that doesn’t look orange or dirty. So, consider this your carefully curated edit of the best cream bronzers that promise to emulate a healthy glow, no sun required.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case selling over 70 million albums, having a residency in Las Vegas and just generally being one of the most famous singers of our time isn’t enough, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/adele" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adele</a> is now rumoured to be adding yet another string to her bow, this time in the form of a <a href="https://stylist.co.uk/tag/beauty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beauty</a> brand.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of other famous founders, including <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/victoria-beckham" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Victoria Beckham</a>, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/lady-gaga" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga</a>, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/hailey-baldwin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hailey Bieber</a>, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/rihanna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Rihanna</a> and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/scarlett-johansson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarlett Johansson</a> (who, can we quickly add, are all living proof that celebrity beauty brands can be good) it seems Adele is finally ready to stop gatekeeping exactly how we can recreate that famous smoky cat eye of hers, the one that we all love so much. </p>
<p>While we don’t have many specific details just yet, current word on the street is that the singer has filed for a trademark for a variety of different products under the brand name The Shelbourne Collective.</p>
<p>We are yet to know what that might mean or where it comes from, but there is every chance that – like <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/make-up/jones-road-beauty-review-where-to-buy-uk/547793" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bobbi Brown’s Jones Road</a> – it might not have any special significance whatsoever.</p>
<p>The list of prospective products is thought to include both eyeshadow and eyeliner, which makes sense given Adele’s go-to make-up look, as well as everything from lipstick and lip balm to body care and perfume. </p>
<p>There’s no mention of anything from Adele herself yet, which sadly means we don’t have any intel as far as a release date goes – and we probably won’t for a while – but we have our fingers crossed for a 2024 launch. And believe us when we say that you’ll be the first to know as soon as we hear even the smallest of details. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For some, the approach of the festive season brings flashbacks of last-minute gift shopping, obligatory multi-generational get-togethers and busy calendars.</p>
<p>And if we’re not rushing around trying to make sure everything is in order for Christmas, we’re fretting about the new year and the trials and tribulations it might bring. But what if we told you there’s a way to avoid the stress of the festive season and ease into this wonderful time of year as cool as a cucumber?</p>
<p>Lined with all manner of shops and glittering with the oldest Christmas lights display in London, <a href="https://www.regentstreetonline.com/christmas?utm_source=stylist-advertorial&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=partner-stylist-advertorial-xmas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Regent Street</a> and <a href="https://stjameslondon.co.uk/christmas?utm_source=stylist-advertorial&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=partner-stylist-advertorial-xmas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">St James’s</a> are perfect for seeking some much needed rejuvenation amongst the chaos. </p>

<h2><\h2><p>When the last item on your list of things to take care of is yourself, the festive season is likely to be nightmarish. </p>
<p>But there’s nothing a good pamper can’t fix and at <a href="https://www.masaj.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MASAJ</a>, based in Quadrant Arcade, you can book yourself in for a bodywork session that’s bound to leave you feeling peaceful and refreshed. </p>

<h2><\h2><p>While it’s virtuous to focus solely on giving at this time of year, a little bit of self-love goes a long way.</p>
<p>And what better way to give yourself some proper TLC than with a little trip to the shops for some much needed self-gifting. </p>
<p>As clichéd as it may sound, buying yourself flowers is the perfect way to treat yourself with something that feels wholesome, and St James’s florist Bulbous has a gorgeous selection of blooms for you to choose from. </p>

<p>So, if you your love language is receiving gifts, don’t wait for somebody else to step up when you can fulfil it all by yourself. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>One of the best ways to stay on top of your wellbeing at this time of year is to keep your body active and moving.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bookworms and TV watchers have been positively spoilt for choice when it comes to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/adaptation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adaptations</a> recently. Joining the ever-growing novel-to-TV-series pipeline is <i>The Doll Factory</i>. The UK wing of new streaming platform <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/paramount-plus-best-tv-shows-movies/674144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paramount+</a> ordered an adaptation of the <i>Sunday Times </i>bestseller and it’s set to be a dark <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/period-dramas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">period drama</a> about sisterhood and obsession.</p>
<p>As well as having the production company behind <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/marcella" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ITV’s <i>Marcella</i></a><i></i> attached to it, there’s also a host of behind-the-scenes talent making us very excited for the new six-part drama.</p>
<p>Here’s everything you need to know about <i>The Doll Factory, </i>including the official trailer.</p>
<h3><b>What is the plot of<i> The Doll Factory</i>? </b></h3>
<p>As mentioned, <i>The Doll Factory</i> will be based on the bestselling 2019 <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/novel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">novel</a> of the same name by Elizabeth Macneal. The <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">book</a> was enough to give us chills (and keep us looking over our shoulder when reading), so we’re excited to see if this new series will recreate the same eerie atmosphere. </p>
<p>According to <i><a href="https://deadline.com/2022/07/paramount-plus-the-doll-factory-adaptation-buccaneer-media-sbs-tvnz-historical-thriller-1235073484/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a></i>, the series – like the book – will be set in London in 1850 and explores the story of Iris, who paints dolls for a living alongside her twin sister, Rose. She dreams of becoming an artist, and by night, secretly paints herself naked.  </p>
<p>Silas is a taxidermist who owns a shop filled with his creations. He dreams of one day finding an item so unique he will be catapulted to fame. Louis is a painter and member of the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, searching for his next muse, and he finds it within Iris.  </p>
<p>Louis soon asks Iris to model for him, and she agrees on the condition that he will also teach her to paint, and suddenly her world expands beyond anything she ever dreamed of. Suddenly before her is the opportunity to escape and start a new life, but in doing so, she must abandon her sister, sacrifice her reputation and launch herself into the unknown. But as Iris’s world expands, a story of dark obsession begins to unfold. </p>
<p>We said it was a chilling one, didn’t we? </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was Valentine’s Day 2023 that Ruby*, a teacher in her early 30s, realised something was different about her boyfriend. They were heading to the gym, as they often did, before a date at an art exhibition in the evening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“He was usually a really helpful coach,” she explains. “I was struggling to get a new exercise right that day, but when I called over for help – as I normally would – he snapped in a way I’d never seen before. He shouted at me across the gym: ‘It’s not my job to help you, you shouldn’t expect so much of me.’ I was really shocked and like, woah, where has this come from? We left the gym, immediately afterwards he said to me: ‘You really need to go away and reflect on the fact that you’re displaying codependent toxic behaviour’.”</p>
<p>To say this came out of the blue is an understatement, Ruby tells me. At that point, Ruby and her boyfriend had been together for the best part of a year,&nbsp;during which she “couldn’t have asked for a better relationship”. They’d met on Hinge, where Ruby was delighted to find a guy who was her type, shared her interests and made references to attachment styles in his profile. “He was studying philosophy and psychology as a mature student,” she says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We had intellectual conversations and immediately set up a date, where we just hit it off straight away. Within a couple of months we were completely exclusive – boyfriend and girlfriend. All of my friends and family met him and were like, ‘oh my goodness you seem so happy, we’ve never seen you like this before, he’s great for you’. I thought I’d found the love of my life, my future husband and father of my children.”</p>
<section class="pp-article__boxout">
<div id="boxout_1" class="pp-boxout" style="background-color:#606060;">
<div class="pp-boxout__body">
<h4>We were having arguments once a week</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>But things changed that day at the gym. “Suddenly, we were having arguments like that once a week, twice a week. It just escalated very quickly,” says Ruby, who also began to notice that her boyfriend’s views about current affairs were shifting. “At some point while we were going out there was the Will Smith ‘slap incident’ at the Oscars. His opinions about that did register as strange to me – there was an emphasis on masculinity and what it means to be a man. He said that it sometimes means asserting yourself violently against other people to defend your woman’s honour. He was coming out with these more traditional, gendered ideals and I definitely questioned it, saying ‘I don’t agree’, but it was kind of like, ‘let’s agree to disagree and move on’.” </p>
<p>Ruby’s boyfriend’s behaviour only became more erratic and aggressive. “We were sitting in a pub having a Sunday roast and he just looked at me with his head tilted and said: ‘You’re so submissive, aren’t you?’” Around the same time, he began to ask questions like, ‘You’re scared of me, aren’t you?’ – and Ruby had a sense that he not only knew she was scared, he wanted her to be.</p>
<section class="pp-article__boxout">
<div id="boxout_1" class="pp-boxout" style="background-color:#606060;">
<div class="pp-boxout__body">
<h4>He said, I’ve come to the hard realisation that I’m an alpha male</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>Then came the statement that made her realise where this behaviour had been coming from. “Not long after the pub incident he said, ‘I’ve come to the hard realisation that I’m an alpha male and you can’t handle me, you obviously want a beta male’ and that was the ‘ding ding ding’ moment,” she says. Ruby’s boyfriend was referring to the myth of male hierarchy supposedly observed among animals like chimpanzees and wolves, in which ‘alpha males’ enjoy a position at the top with greater access to power and mates, while weaker, submissive ‘beta males’ are below them. </p>
<p>It was the summer of 2022 that Ruby’s boyfriend immersed himself in this kind of discourse, while waiting to start a Masters course and working ad hoc jobs making cold calls and doing manual labour. “He found it boring so he’d started listening to a lot of podcasts,” she says. “He’d shown me bits and bobs but it wasn’t until the start of this year that he would reference them and use them in arguments to justify opinions about our relationship.”</p>
<p>Ruby can’t remember everything he referenced, but she knows he started listening to The Joe Rogan Experience, and then followed offshoots from that, consuming content from guests on the show. The controversial Spotify podcast has attracted much criticism for offensive remarks, including sexist comments, racial slurs, misinformation about Covid and derogatory comments about trans people. Ruby’s boyfriend also mentioned content from Jordan Peterson, a Canadian psychology professor famous for his all red meat diet and YouTube videos that tell viewers what being an alpha male ‘REALLY means’. It’s all part of the deeply troubling online ‘manosphere’ community, a collection of men’s support communities that, at their most extreme, advocate aggressively misogynistic views, such as those expressed by self-proclaimed misogynist influencer Andrew Tate. </p>
<p>Ruby knew about this dangerous world thanks to Lily O’Farrell, the feminist writer and cartoonist (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/vulgadrawings/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@vulgadrawings</a>), who creates informative content about the online world. “I knew what I was dealing with after the alpha male comment,” says Ruby. But then, things got even stranger. “We’d just woken up on a Sunday morning and he was like, ‘So I’ve been hearing on this podcast about semen retention and how it’s going to be really good for me to hold onto my power’,” she says. He then explained that they could still have a sexual relationship but that he would ‘edge’, which means stopping stimulation to avoid ejaculation. “I looked into it and there are some wild videos that say a man’s seed is magical, which is why women are always trying to harvest it from them,” says Ruby. </p>
<p>“On some levels it [claims to be] about testosterone and building muscle, but then there’s a crossover into this spiritual world. He told me that ‘the abusive power of feminism was flowing through me and I was possessed and had an entity attached to me and needed to see a shaman to have it cleared’.” This conversation was the last straw.</p>
<p>“Now I can laugh about it because I can see it’s just completely ridiculous, but at the time it was disturbing because this was a person I was completely in love with,” says Ruby. “You know <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/what-is-gaslighting-in-a-relationship/202472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaslighting</a> – it works. I’d been in it for some time and I was, at that point, questioning my own sanity.” With the support of friends, family and colleagues, she was able to extract herself from the situation, breaking up with her boyfriend in a public place with friends waiting nearby. “One tip I would give is to talk to the people around you and not be worried about tarnishing your partner’s character in the eyes of your friends,” she says. “You need that reality check and the sounding board of other people.” </p>
<p>Another piece of advice she offers is to be aware of any new content your partner is consuming. “Without trying to be a private investigator or crossing a boundary, do some research,” she says. “I wish I’d been more willing to have those uncomfortable conversations and follow that line of enquiry.”</p>
<p>Of course, it shouldn’t have been up to Ruby to prevent this from happening, as Lily O’Farrell reminds us. “There’s a common narrative around abusive relationships – that you should have left sooner,” says Lily. “But the responsibility is on the online platforms that allow this harmful content to flourish, not the women in men’s lives. It’s not your fault if someone you love gets radicalised.” </p>
<p>Now, however, Ruby is attuned to all the warning signs someone might be getting involved in this world. “If people I encounter are giving strong hints – like reading Jordan Peterson, for example – I try really hard to listen and not confront them. I don’t think it’s helpful to be combative because from what I can tell, the people who get lured into this sphere are feeling rejected, insecure and vulnerable. But it can’t go unquestioned either. So I try to listen, be empathetic and ask questions.”</p>
<p>When it comes to dating, she approaches it with hyper-vigilance. “You’re worried about spotting those red flags. My current partner is having to be a bit more patient in terms of earning my trust, but that’s ok. The place to start from is trusting your intuition and knowing your worth. When you’re there, you’re not going to let anyone cross your boundaries or step on you. And then you can feel safe allowing people in.”</p>
<p><i>*Name has been changed</i></p>
<h2><\h2><p>Ruby’s experience is all too common. If you, or someone you know, find yourself in a similar situation, psychologist and relationship adviser Barbara Santini shares five tips below.</p>
<p>“If you feel it’s too late and the relationship is no longer healthy for you, it’s important to have a plan to leave safely. Reach out to friends, family, or professional services that can provide support during this transition. Remember, prioritising your wellbeing is not selfish – it’s necessary.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>Communication is the cornerstone of any strong relationship. Begin with expressing your feelings without accusation. For example, “I’ve noticed some changes in your interests and I’m feeling concerned. Can we talk about it?” This opens up a space for understanding rather than confrontation.</p>
<h2><\h2><p>Before approaching your partner, it’s essential to understand where they’re coming from. Familiarise yourself with the content they’re consuming. This knowledge will enable you to have a more informed and empathetic conversation.</p>
<h2><\h2><p>Share your core values and ask about theirs. Questions like “What does being an ‘alpha male’ mean to you?” can lead to deeper insights into their aspirations and fears. Understanding these can be key to addressing the underlying issues.</p>
<h2><\h2><p>Sometimes, these interests stem from insecurities or a lack of direction. Suggest working on self-improvement together, whether it’s through joint activities, counselling or seminars that promote healthy self-esteem and mutual respect.
	  </p>
<h2><\h2><p> If you believe the ideology is harmful, it’s crucial to set boundaries. Make it clear what you’re comfortable with and what you’re not. If they cross these boundaries, it may be time to reassess the relationship’s future.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us do a lot of our beauty shopping online these days: whether it’s purchasing your go-to shampoo and conditioner during a flash sale, picking up a new bottle of your favourite foundation as part of a bigger Boots order or throwing a cleanser into a virtual shopping basket while you do your weekly shop.</p>
<p>It’s something that we’re guilty of doing, but there’s so much forgotten joy that can be found in the time spent slowly browsing independent beauty shops with friends, going from counter to counter in various department stores or visiting the standalone boutiques and temporary pop-ups that are home to your favourite brands, each one offering an entirely different shopping experience.</p>
<p>Being able to wander aimlessly, swatching, spritzing and sniffing as you go, speaking to sales advisors and learning about the products that are so beautifully displayed all around you – especially in the lead-up to Christmas – is something that shouldn’t be underestimated.</p>
<p>So, if you’re in the mood to refresh your make-up bag or treat somebody else, here’s our round-up of the best places to shop, enjoy and experience beauty in London. </p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">Glossier Realms of You</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>Separate to Glossier’s standalone store in Covent Garden, Realms of You is an immersive pop-up experience that celebrates the brand’s bestselling fragrance, You. Designed by the brand’s in-house team, it features a series of rooms allowing visitors to experience the scent through each of the five senses. Open from 18 November though to 14 January 2024, there is, of course, exclusive merch available to buy, including a pepper grinder (inspired by the perfume’s notes of pink pepper) and a mini microphone to ‘amplify the sounds of you’. </p>
<p><i>Nearest tube station: Oxford Circus</i></p>
<p><b><i>Glossier Realms of You, 173 Regent Street, London, W1B 4JQ</i></b></p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">Sculpted by Aimee</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>A brand that keeps going from strength to strength, Sculpted by Aimee is opening the doors to its first London boutique this week, and we couldn’t be more excited. The brainchild of make-up artist Aimee Connolly, the brand launched in 2016 and has seen exponential growth ever since. There are already two boutiques in its home country of Ireland, but this is the first in the UK. Here, you’ll be able to shop customer favourites, like Cream Luxe Blush and Second Skin Dewy Foundation, as well as booking in for make-up application ahead of big events.</p>
<p><i>Nearest Tube station: Oxford Circus</i></p>
<p><i><b>Sculpted by Aimee, 20 Fouberts Place, London, W1F 7PL</b></i></p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">Earl of East</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>A new addition to Quadrant Arcade, situated just off Regent Street, is Earl of East’s first beauty-focussed store. Known for its collection of home fragrance, bathing and self-care products, the shop also stocks a number of other carefully curated brands that align with its ethos, including AKT London, Guy Morgan and Mirror Water. Plus, you’ll find a selection of chic homeware, and you can even book in for a candle making workshop. </p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">Sephora</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>As of this week there are now two Sephora stores in London, the original in Westfield White City, but the newest addition is in Westfield Stratford City. Both offer a similar range of brands, including some that are new to the UK, like Patrick Starr’s One Size, Lady Gaga’s Haus Labs and Makeup by Mario, as well as Sephora Collection, but you’ll find others, like Salt and Stone, Naked Sundays, Adowah Beauty and Straand exclusively in Stratford so if that’s not a reason to hop on the Central line and visit both shops, we don’t know what is.</p>
<p><i>Nearest tube station: Stratford International</i></p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">Jo Malone London</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>As well as having a number of idyllic stores dotted around the city, Jo Malone London is calling Glide at Battersea Power Station home for the festive season. As well as a riverside ice rink (open from 10 November through to 7 January), a 30ft tree adorned with classic cream boxes,  there’s also an immersive Gingerbread Land experience where you can browse and shop the brand’s festive fragrances, as well as being able to customise bottles and boxes with bespoke personalisation. </p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">PureSeoul Soho</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>If you want to shop K-beauty in real life, then PureSeoul is one of the places to visit. Jam-packed with so many innovative, exciting and must-try brands that aren’t readily available in many other brick-and-mortar stores. Plus, the friendly and knowledgeable staff are on hand to help you navigate the shelves. </p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">Malin + Goetz</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>What was only supposed to be a pop-up location for a few months, this store has been open for almost a year. On the ground floor you’ll find a selection of Malin + Goetz favourites, from candles to shower gel and hand cream, while upstairs is often transformed into experiential spaces. Formerly the rum room – to celebrate the brand’s much-loved Dark Rum range – it’s now been turned into the strawberry bar in honour of the newest fragrance franchise.</p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">Liberty London</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>One of the city’s most iconic department stores, Liberty London is a treasure trove of beauty brands, both big and small. The smell when you walk in is enough to make you want to stay there for hours on end, just browsing and taking it all in. The Diptyque fragrance space is a candle lover’s dream and it’s worth stopping by just to experience that. </p>
<p><i>Nearest Tube station: Oxford Circus</i></p>

</figure>
<h4 class="listicle__title">Les Senteurs</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>Home to a seriously impressive range of niche fragrance brands, Les Senteurs is one of the city’s hidden perfume gems that’s well worth a visit if you’re in town. You can browse, smell and explore in your own time, and the warm, seriously knowledgeable team will be on hand to help you out if needed. So if you’re looking for a new signature scent or for another fragrance to add to your collection, this is the place to go for something truly unique and special. </p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">Omorovicza London Institute</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>Taking inspiration from the brand’s institute in Budapest, Omorovicza has opened its doors to the first London boutique. Combining the centuries-old wellness traditions that the brand is renowned for, there’s a menu of six Skin Therapy sessions based around traditional Hungarian massage – with one of them being exclusive to the London Institute – as well as a retail space to browse and purchase products recommended by your skin therapist.

<h4 class="listicle__title">Glossier </h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>Following the success of its temporary pop-up, a couple of years ago Glossier opened a permanent flagship location in Covent Garden in what is said to be its oldest surviving building in the piazza – if you haven’t been yet, you’re missing out. Even if you don’t buy anything (but can we recommend checking out the exclusive merch or treating yourself to a Balm Dotcom), the store alone is an experience: decked out like a chic showroom, you can play with and discover products to your heart’s content, plus the huge mirrored entrance makes for the perfect Instagram-worthy photo opportunity. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we talk about hormonal health, a lot of focus tends to be placed on what we can do to take back control. From <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/nutrition-for-hormones-eat-better-ovarian-health/572325" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hormone-balancing diets</a> to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/pilates-menopause-benefits/823565" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">menopause-friendly pilates routines</a>, there’s plenty of practical advice out there for anyone looking to support their hormonal balance and alleviate uncomfortable symptoms.</p>
<p>However, that doesn’t mean your hormones are solely influenced by the lifestyle choices you make. </p>
<p>While external influences such as diet and exercise can play a role, they’re not going to completely transform your hormonal profile. Our genes, however, hold significant sway over our body’s hormonal system. Here are four key facts you need to know.</p>
<h2><\h2><p>“Our genes provide the codes for the building blocks or amino acids that regulate enzyme and protein production that enable the body to make hormones,” explains Dr Ghazala Aziz-Scott, a GP, functional medicine expert and women’s health specialist at the <a href="https://www.mariongluckclinic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marion Gluck Clinic</a>.  </p>
<p>“These proteins are involved in hormone synthesis and production, transport (because the hormones are bound to proteins in the blood), sensitivity and detoxification.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>Several of our genes are involved in the hormonal response process – ie when hormones rise or fall in response to certain stimuli – so variations in these genes can also contribute to our overall hormonal balance. </p>
<p>According to Dr Aziz-Scott, a key example of this process is seen within the creation of the enzyme aromatase, which converts testosterone into oestrogen. If the gene responsible for creating this enzyme is upregulated – a term which simply means the gene is more active – more of the enzyme will be created and released, consequently leading to an increase in oestrogen levels.  </p>
<p>Other genetic variations can also lead to an imbalance in oestrogen – or at least the symptoms that come with it. For example, if the genes that create your oestrogen receptors – the parts of your body which control your hormone sensitivity – have a certain variation, your body may become more sensitive to oestrogen.</p>
<p>“Oestrogen is also cleared from the body by a process called methylation, so if the genes involved in this are less efficient, oestrogen clearance can be affected and levels can rise,” Dr Aziz-Scott continues. “The expression of these genes can also be affected by environmental factors or epigenetics such as diet, lifestyle, ageing, stress, sleep, immune function and environmental toxins.”</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why lifestyle changes can have a knock-on effect on your hormones; by influencing the genes which create the proteins that go on to become hormones, the whole system is affected. </p>

<h2><\h2><p>Hormonal conditions such as <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/pcos-awareness-month-2022-experts/705604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCOS</a> can also be fuelled by certain genetic variations, Dr Aziz-Scott adds. This is on top of the environmental factors – such as diet and gut health – that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8643565/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20high%2Dsugar%20foods,to%20the%20occurrence%20of%20PCOS." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have also been found</a> to play a potential role. “PCOS runs in families,” she says.  </p>
<p>The genetic variations associated with PCOS affect several different areas, including the body’s androgen receptors – a type of hormone which is typically elevated in people with PCOS. The receptors associated with the menstrual hormones (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) are also affected, as is the receptor for leptin – the hormone which controls appetite and affects blood sugar control. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>But the relationship between our genes and hormones doesn’t end here. Indeed, Dr Aziz-Scott highlights, your hormones can also have a knock-on effect on how your genes are expressed. </p>
<p>“Steroid hormones such as cortisol, oestradiol, progesterone and testosterone can bind to the intracellular receptors that affect gene expression,” she explains. “For example, cortisol receptors are present within many different cells throughout the body, so when cortisol levels rise, it changes the expression of thousands of genes that affect immune responses, metabolism, growth and many more processes.”</p>
<p>Hormonal health is clearly a lot more complex than adding a few new foods to your diet, so don’t get bogged down by content that makes it seem like you should have everything under control.</p>
<p>Educating yourself on the exact problems you’re facing – either by visiting a GP or hormonal health professional – is the best place to start if you’re experiencing uncomfortable symptoms, as they might be able to suggest specific lifestyle changes which could make a difference. Eating well, exercising regularly and getting enough sleep will also help to keep things ticking along – all of which will offer benefits outside the realm of your hormones.  </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eyebrow trends come and go. From thick and fluffy to those that are drawn on with military precision. Even the thin 90s-esque brows are slowly making a comeback into modern life. However you like yours, there’s no denying that the everlasting popularity of the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/make-up/fluffy-eyebrows-hack/602958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full brow</a> has brought with it myriad innovative inventions. </p>
<p>And, while I’m particularly partial to the type of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/make-up/eyebrow-gels/621343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eyebrow gels</a> that come with a brush and can be used for my baby, flyaway <i>and</i> brow hairs, finding one that truly works has been a journey. </p>
<p>However, my research did lead to an interesting finding: the brow gel you choose is important, yes, but it’s the application that makes a sizeable difference, too. </p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="eyebrow gel hack" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2022/11/28102837/img_7308.png-1120x1120.png">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Morgan Fargo</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Loading each eyebrow with gel before attempting to brush them into shape was something I had seen <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/make-up-tips-expert-beauty-advice/262985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make-up artists</a> do as second nature, but, somewhat foolishly, it wasn’t a technique that I adopted into my own routine until later than necessary.</p>
<p>Where before I would comb my brow up once or twice (and be inevitably disappointed when it fell down within the hour), taking the extra few seconds to massage the product into the hair made the world of difference. </p>
<p>The fluffy, full look I was attempting came true. And it lasted all day! Here’s what to do. </p>
<h3>1. Clean the hair</h3>
<p>Before you do anything to your eyebrows, take a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/skincare/best-reusable-makeup-remover-pads-cloths/446561" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cotton pad</a> (reusable or otherwise), a towel or a face cloth and gently wipe any product from your eyebrows. If you do your eyebrows last in your routine, it’s likely other make-up –like foundation, powder or even skincare – will be on them and hinder how well the brow gel is able to adhere. </p>
<h3>2. Brush the gel in every direction</h3>
<p>Take your eyebrow gel wand, toothbrush or spoolie and coat it with the product. Then, brush it into the hair in a variety of directions, focusing on even coverage from the root to the tip of the hair. </p>
<h3>3. Lay the hairs in place</h3>
<p>Finally, brush the hairs into the shape you want. Try to avoid pulling a jumper or top over your head while your brows are drying, which could cause the hairs to become muddled and messy again.</p>
<p>Some make-up artists suggest holding the eyebrow in shape for up to 10 seconds straight afterwards to intensify the hold.</p></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’re working from home, the light outside is dreary, and the buzz of your morning coffee has well and truly worn off – yet there are still hours to go before you can log off. At these low-on-motivation moments, you might find your mind drifting to your snack supplies. What can you nibble on to give your afternoon a boost? What would go particularly well with your 3pm cup of tea? </p>
<p>There are plenty of answers to this question, and many of them can be found in <i><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/4756/9781922616883" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chocolate All Day</a></i>, the new cookbook by acclaimed Australian chocolatier Kirsten Tibballs (one of the most-followed female pastry chefs on Instagram, incidentally). Focused on chocolate recipes that are “big on wow and low on difficulty”, <i>Chocolate All Day</i> contains easy-to-follow instructions for baking everything from chocolate babka knots to sticky date chocolate puddings. </p>

</figure>
<p>Below, Tibballs shares three recipes for snackable chocolatey treats perfect for lifting you out of an afternoon slump. That means chocolate-chip cookie sandwiches with orange ganache; peanut cookie cups with chocolate caramel filling; and a caramel slice topped with milk chocolate ganache. </p>
<p>All of these recipes make a sizeable batch of treats, which can then be stored in an airtight container in your fridge for whenever you get peckish. The caramel slice and chocolate-chip cookie sandwiches will last for up to a fortnight, while the peanut cookie cups will stay delicious for up to a month. Honestly, though? We challenge anyone to resist polishing them off for that long. </p>

</ul>
<p><b>Method </b></p>
<p>To make the orange ganache, heat the cream, orange zest and vanilla in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to the boil.</p>
<p>Place the milk chocolate in a bowl.</p>
<p>Once the cream is boiling, strain it over the chocolate. Whisk until the chocolate is completely melted and incorporated into the cream.</p>
<p>Cover with plastic wrap touching the surface of the ganache. </p>
<p>Leave to cool at room temperature for 2–3 hours before transferring to a piping bag or snaplock bag.</p>
<p>For the cookies, preheat the oven to 170°C (325°F) fan-forced. Line a baking tray with baking paper.</p>
<p>Place the raw sugar, brown sugar, salt and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment and beat on medium speed until smooth.</p>
<p>Add the egg and vanilla and mix to combine.</p>
<p>Sift in the flour and bicarbonate of soda and mix until incorporated.</p>
<p>Remove the bowl from the mixer, add the chocolate and crushed cornflakes and stir them through.</p>
<p>Place the cookie dough in the fridge for 1 hour.</p>
<p>Roll teaspoonfuls of the dough into balls. Place them on the baking tray approximately 4cm (1½ inches) apart and gently press down on them to flatten slightly.</p>
<p>Bake for 10 minutes or until golden brown.</p>
<p>Remove from the oven and leave to cool at room temperature. Repeat with the remaining cookie dough.</p>
<p>To assemble, cut the tip off the prepared piping bag of orange-infused ganache.</p>
<p>Pipe the ganache onto every second cookie and sandwich them together with the plain cookies.</p>
<p>Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. </p>
<p>The cookie dough can be prepared in advance and stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Allow the dough to come back to room temperature before baking.</p>
<p><b>For best results</b></p>
<p>If your room temperature is warm, place the ganache in the fridge to firm it up to piping consistency.</p>
<p><b>Fix it</b></p>
<p>If the ganache looks grainy after you add the cream to the chocolate, add a tiny bit more cream and continue whisking.</p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">Peanut cookie cups with chocolate caramel filling</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p><b>Kirsten says: </b>“Just when you thought a chocolate and peanut flavour combo couldn’t get any better. Here, a biscuity peanut butter base acts as a little bowl for lush honeyed caramel, with chocolate whisked through in the final step because, well… chocolate. Believe me, you will fall in love with these wickedly irresistible caramel cups.”</p>
<p><i>Makes 12</i></p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<p>For the peanut cookie cups:</p>
<ul>
<li>85g (3 oz) unsalted butter </li>
<li>65g (2¼ oz) soft brown sugar </li>
<li>65g (2¼ oz) caster (superfine) sugar </li>
<li>95g (3¼ oz) crunchy peanut butter </li>
<li>30g (1 oz) whole egg </li>
<li>125g (4½ oz) plain (all-purpose) flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
<li>pinch of baking powder </li>
<li>pinch of sea salt </li>
<li>75g (2½ oz) good-quality milk chocolate, chopped </li>
</ul>
<p>For the caramel filling: </p>
<ul>
<li>250ml (9 fl oz) thickened (whipping) cream</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste </li>
<li>pinch of sea salt </li>
<li>185g (6½ oz) caster (superfine) sugar </li>
<li>65g (2¼ oz) liquid glucose </li>
<li>35ml (1¼ fl oz) water </li>
<li>150g (5½ oz) unsalted butter </li>
<li>25g (1 oz) honey </li>
<li>½ teaspoon bicarbonate of soda (baking soda)</li>
<li>75g (2½ oz) good-quality milk chocolate</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Method </b></p>
<p>To make the peanut cookie cups, preheat the oven to 170°C (325°F) fan-forced. Grease a 12-hole muffin tin.</p>
<p>Using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugars on medium speed until well combined and completely smooth. </p>
<p>Add the peanut butter followed by the egg and mix to combine. </p>
<p>Add the flour, baking powder and salt, then mix until almost completely incorporated. </p>
<p>Lastly, add the chopped milk chocolate and mix until the ingredients just come together as a dough. </p>
<p>On a lightly floured work surface, divide the dough into 12 even portions.</p>
<p>Place the pieces of dough into the holes in the tin, pressing them into the base and sides to form a cup. </p>
<p>Line each cup with scrunched then flattened baking paper, and fill with uncooked rice. Bake for 8 minutes. (This is called blind baking.)</p>
<p>Remove the paper and rice and bake for a further 10 minutes. </p>
<p>Leave to cool slightly. When the cookie cups are firm enough to handle but still warm, remove from the tin and leave to cool completely at room temperature on a wire rack. </p>
<p>Clean and dry the muffin tin. </p>
<p>When the cookie cups have cooled completely, return them to the clean tin.</p>
<p>For the caramel filling, heat the cream, vanilla and salt in a saucepan over medium heat until almost boiling.</p>
<p>Heat the sugar, glucose and water in a large saucepan over medium heat until the temperature reaches 145°C (293°F).</p>
<p>Reduce the heat to low, immediately add the butter and honey and whisk by hand to incorporate. </p>
<p>One-third at a time, pour the hot cream mixture over the caramel and whisk to combine. </p>
<p>Carefully add the bicarbonate of soda, then increase the heat and bring to 118°C (244°F) while whisking continuously.</p>
<p>Once the caramel reaches temperature, remove from the heat and immediately add the chocolate. Whisk until the chocolate is completely melted and incorporated.</p>
<p>Pour the caramel into the prepared peanut cookie cups and leave to set at room temperature for 1 hour. </p>
<p>Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 weeks.</p>
<p><b>Next level</b></p>
<p>This recipe can also make one spectacular large tart. Press the cookie dough into a fluted flan (tart) tin, then follow the recipe. Serve slices with fresh cream or ice cream.</p>
<p>The peanut cookie cup mixture can be used to make beautiful cookies.</p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">Caramel slice topped with milk chocolate ganache</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p><b>Kirsten says: </b>“Just when you think caramel slice (sometimes known as millionaire’s shortbread) can’t get any better, I bring you this new level of decadence. What makes this caramel slice so good? Chocolate, of course. Here you’ll find it nestled in the biscuit base, humming in the caramel filling and crowning this slice in the form of a glossy ganache.”</p>
<p><i>Makes 18 pieces</i></p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<p>For the biscuit base:</p>
<ul>
<li>125g (4½ oz) unsalted butter, melted</li>
<li>200g (7 oz) soft brown sugar</li>
<li>120g (4¼ oz) plain (all-purpose) flour</li>
<li>50g (1¾ oz) desiccated coconut pinch of ground cinnamon</li>
<li>50g (1¾ oz) good-quality milk chocolate, roughly chopped</li>
</ul>
<p>For the caramel filling:</p>
<ul>
<li>80g (2¾ oz) unsalted butter, cubed</li>
<li>80g (2¾ oz) soft brown sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>395ml (13¾ fl oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
<li>90g (3¼ oz) good-quality dark chocolate</li>
</ul>
<p>For the ganache topping:</p>
<ul>
<li>250g (9 oz) good-quality milk chocolate</li>
<li>100ml (3½ fl oz) thickened (whipping) cream</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>30g (1 oz) liquid glucose</li>
<li>pinch of sea salt</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Method </b></p>
<p>To make the biscuit base, preheat the oven to 160°C (315°F) fan-forced. </p>
<p>Grease a slice (slab) tin, 27.5 x 17.5cm (11 x 6¾ inches) and 3.5cm (1¼ inches) high. Line the base and sides of the tin with baking paper and set aside until required.</p>
<p>Put the melted butter and brown sugar in a bowl and mix with a wooden spoon to combine. Add the flour, coconut and cinnamon. Continue to mix until the ingredients come together.</p>
<p>Add the milk chocolate and mix to combine.</p>
<p>Press the mixture into the base of the prepared baking tin to create an even layer.</p>
<p>Bake for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Remove from the oven and set aside at room temperature.</p>
<p>Reduce the oven temperature to 140°C (275°F) fan-forced.</p>
<p>For the caramel filling, combine the butter, brown sugar and vanilla in a saucepan over medium heat.</p>
<p>Once the butter has melted and the sugar has completely dissolved, reduce the heat to low, add the condensed milk and whisk continuously until the mixture begins to simmer. Continuing to whisk, cook for a further 3 minutes until the mixture begins to thicken slightly.</p>
<p>Remove from the heat and add the dark chocolate. Mix until the chocolate is melted and incorporated into the caramel.</p>
<p>Pour the caramel filling over the biscuit base and spread to create an even layer.</p>
<p>Bake for approximately 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Remove from the oven and leave the slice to cool completely at room temperature.</p>
<p>For the ganache topping, place the chocolate in a bowl.</p>
<p>Combine the cream, vanilla, glucose and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to the boil, then pour the mixture over the chocolate. Gently whisk until the chocolate is completely melted and incorporated into the other ingredients.</p>
<p>Pour the ganache over the cooled caramel layer and spread evenly. (For a less rich version, make the slice without the ganache topping.)</p>
<p>Place the slice in the fridge for 30 minutes to set.</p>
<p>Remove the caramel slice from the tin and cut it into 18 rectangles, approximately 9 x 2.8cm (3½ x 1¼ inches).</p>
<p>Store the slice in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.</p>
<p><b>Next level</b></p>
<p>To add a little dazzle, rub some edible gold lustre dust into shaved or shredded coconut and sprinkle it on top of each bar.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a chic outfit with minimal fuss? A knitted twinset – meaning a simple knitted top and matching button-up cardigan – is your winter port of call. With ample options for styling, these two coordinating pieces are your shortcut to looking instantly put-together.</p>
<p>Team together or wear separately with knitted knickers, tights and pointed toe kitten heels a la Miu Miu autumn/winter 2023, a librarian-chic look that has since been adopted by<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> it-girls</a> and influencers alike, including Emma Corrin and Bella Hadid. For further inspiration, you only need to look towards Missoni, whose nifty twinsets are packed with vibrancy and intricate patterns to add a pop of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/how-to-wear-dopamine-dressing-in-cold-weather/838970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">colour</a>.</p>
<p>Amp up the drama of a knitted top and cardi by wearing with a tailored pair of wide-leg trousers or an ankle-grazing A-line skirt. For more casual moments, dress down with slouchy denim jeans and sleek sporty trainers (we love the bright <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/best-patterned-coloured-trainers/632419" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">colourwave </a>styles of the Onitsuka Tigers and Adidias Sambas) for a relaxed, daytime look.</p>
<p>Whatever your occasion or sartorial preference, there’s a co-ord for everyone. From luxe lounging styles to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/best-fine-knit-cardigans-autumn/820386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">classic crew-necks</a>, these are the best knitted twin-sets you’ll never want to take off. </p>

<h3><b>If Not Now, When?<br />

<p>There’s nothing quite like a big bowl of porridge to warm you up on a dark, cold morning, and this concoction from Carl White of Nopi, Ottolenghi’s Soho-based restaurant, is one you won’t want to miss. <a href="https://rudehealth.com/blogs/recipes/miso-butterscotch-porridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devised for Rude Health</a>, this recipe sees sweet and salty oats piled with fresh fruit, coconut shavings and mixed nuts. Delicious. 
	  </p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>For the bircher:</p>
<ul>
<li>200ml coconut milk</li>
<li>100g oats</li>
<li>2 eating apples, coarsely grated</li>
<li>50g mixed seeds (such as sunflower, pumpkin, sesame and linseed)</li>
<li>25g mixed nuts (such as walnuts, brazil nuts, almonds and cashews)</li>
<li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
<li>200ml cold water</li>
</ul>
<p>For the miso butterscotch: </p>
<ul>
<li>150g white miso paste, at room temperature</li>
<li>50ml mirin</li>
<li>30g light brown sugar</li>
<li>2 tsp sherry vinegar</li>
<li>40g unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
</ul>
<p>For the toppings: </p>
<ul>
<li>40g mango, peeled and cut into large cubes</li>
<li>40g apple, peeled and cut into large cubes</li>
<li>40g pomegranate seeds</li>
<li>20g toasted coconut shavings</li>
<li>30g mixed nuts (such as walnuts, brazil nuts, almonds and cashews)</li>
<li>Baby basil</li>
</ul>
<p>To finish:</p>
<ul>
<li>200g coconut milk</li>
<li>140g light brown sugar</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 160°C/gas mark 3</li>
<li>Make the miso butterscotch using a rubber spatula to spread the miso paste out thinly and evenly on a parchment-lined baking tray. Place the tray in the oven and roast for 20-25 minutes until the miso has turned to a dark caramel, where the sides look burnt and the middle a dark golden brown. </li>
<li>Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. Scrape the burnt miso paste off the parchment paper, breaking it as you go, and transfer the pieces to a food processor along with the mirin, sugar, vinegar, butter and one tablespoon of water. Blitz well for five minutes to form a smooth aerated paste.</li>
<li>To make the bircher, put together the porridge oats, mixed seeds, half of the mixed nuts, cinnamon and the grated apple into a mixing bowl. Add 200ml of both coconut drink and cold water, mix well, then put into a sealed container and leave for two hours or overnight.</li>
<li>Put the other 200ml of coconut drink, light brown sugar and 40g of the miso butterscotch into a pan to warm through then add your Bircher. Stir for 3-4 minutes on a medium heat until it’s nice and creamy.</li>
<li>Spoon the porridge into three bowls. Divide the mango, apple, pomegranate seeds, toasted coconut shavings and the rest of the mixed nuts into each bowl and garnish with the baby basil.</li>
</ol>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re in pain, seeking expert help is a good place to start. </p>
<p>Whether you’ve got a niggle in your knee after <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/training-first-half-marathon/808949" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a half marathon</a> or you’ve strained your back lifting in the gym, getting your injury diagnosed and treated can speed up your healing time and prevent you from making things worse.  </p>
<p>However, while deciding to seek help may be easy, knowing where and from whom to seek that help can be a little trickier. The number of clinics on offer aside, working out what kind of expert your injury requires can be difficult if you’re not familiar with the terminology.  </p>
<p>So, to help you work your way through the jargon, we’ve put together this simple guide that explains the difference between physiotherapy, osteopathy and sports massage, and looks at the injuries and conditions each one is designed to help.  </p>
<h2><\h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="A woman having physio" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/13162405/physio-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To find out more about each of the three, we asked Claire Small, chief clinical officer and consultant physiotherapist at <a href="https://puresportsmed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pure Sports Medicine</a>, to explain a bit more.  </p>
<h3>Physiotherapy </h3>
<p>We’ve all heard of physiotherapy in some form or another, but what does a physiotherapist do? “Physiotherapy is a medical service with a broad understanding of different conditions,” Small explains. “It looks at your musculoskeletal system, working to support it to perform in the best way so you’re able to do the activities you want to do pain-free.” </p>
<p>While physiotherapists may do some hands-on therapy – manipulating different parts of the body and helping to aid movement – a lot of the treatment tends to be movement and exercise-led, Small adds. </p>
<h3>Osteopathy </h3>
<p>The reason why many of us often get physiotherapy and osteopathy mixed up is that they share a lot of similarities, especially in their areas of focus. </p>
<p>“Osteopathy is a medical service that also looks at your musculoskeletal system, and has a lot of crossover with physiotherapy,” Small explains. “However, you can expect more manual and hands-on therapy within the treatments of osteopathy.”</p>
<p>This hands-on approach often means osteopathy is more session-based, while physiotherapy is a combination of in-house sessions and at-home rehabilitation. Osteopathy also tends to adopt a more holistic approach, looking at how the different parts of the musculoskeletal system work together, so it’s often used to address issues in the back and spinal area as opposed to arm and leg joints. </p>
<h3>Sports massage  </h3>
<p>Sports massage, while still a medical service, is more concerned with treating tension and pain as opposed to understanding the route of the issue. Because of this, it’s often used to support or supplement physiotherapy and osteopathy treatment.  </p>
<p>“Massage therapy, also called soft tissue massage therapy, allows the muscles to release tension or stiffness, which then allows you to move more freely and with a better range of motion,” Small says.  </p>
<p>Sports massage can be used both pre- and post-exercise to help speed up recovery and reduce your risk of injury by ensuring the muscles are relaxed and tension-free. </p>
<h2><\h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="A woman having physio" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/13162755/physio-treatment-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The kind of treatment that will work best for you depends on whether you’re injured or just dealing with a lot of tension.  </p>
<p>“You might see a physiotherapist or osteopath if you have sustained an injury or are in pain, while you may see a massage therapist if you are training for or have completed a race or event, have tightness or tension or have a lack of movement in an area of your body,” Small says. </p>
<p>“You might also see a massage therapist if you’re pregnant or if you’ve recently had a baby. Or you may get regular massage therapy to support your ongoing physical wellbeing and sporting goals.” </p>
<p>Deciding between an osteopath and a physiotherapist can be tricky, but keep in mind that osteopaths tend to be a bit more hands-on and adopt a more holistic approach, while physiotherapy is usually more targeted and involves at-home rehabilitation. </p>
<p>However, says Small, more important than picking a specific discipline is the clinician you’re booking to see. You want to not only ensure that your clinician is up to date with the latest research and using a range of techniques in your treatment – including manual therapy, exercise prescription and education – but also that they have expertise in the area you need. </p>
<p>“Many clinicians today are employed on skills and specialist basis, meaning they have committed themselves to certain injuries,” Small explains. “In these instances, their expertise is more important than their title; in the same way that GPs have different areas of interest, the same is true in this area of medicine.” </p>
<h2><\h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="A woman with an osteopath" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/13162837/doctor-women-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While it’s possible to seek help for sports injuries and conditions through the NHS, some people opt to seek treatment privately to speed up the process. In cases such as this, it’s important to keep a few things in mind while searching for an expert, Small says. </p>
<p>Below is a checklist of things she recommends looking into both before and during treatment. Your clinician should: </p>
<ul>
<li>ask you why you are seeking treatment, what you expect of the clinician and what you want to get from the consultation </li>
<li>allow you to tell your story </li>
<li>explain the problem and ensure you understand what is being said </li>
<li>discuss different treatment options and the various implications of these and allow you to decide together what the most suitable course of action is (a process known as shared decision-making) </li>
<li>outline and discuss a treatment plan with you that works towards you achieving your goals, including what they will suggest if your condition fails to respond </li>
<li>if you aren’t improving, discuss options for second opinions</li>
</ul>
<p>“If people aren’t getting this from the clinician they are seeing – it doesn’t matter if they are a physio, an osteopath or a massage therapist – they are not following the latest evidence and, at the very least, the patient should feel they can question the care they are receiving – or seek a second opinion,” Small says.</p>
<p>“Like every other profession and customer service industry out there, there are great physios, osteopaths and sports massage therapists, but there are also very poor ones. Good clinical care requires people to stay up to date with new developments.” </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cast your mind back to circa 2006, when Kate Moss pirouetted the pavements of Primrose Hill in a pair of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/ballet-flats/771159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ballet slippers</a> and we all rushed out to pick up our own pink-toned pairs. Eventually, the craze died down in favour of the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/best-white-trainers-women/348170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">classic white trainer</a>, but fast forward to today and dancewear is, yet again, well and truly dominating our <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wardrobes</a>.   </p>
<p>From Bella Hadid in knitted legwarmers to Hailey Bieber, Doja Cat and Jennifer Lawrence strolling around on their morning coffee run in pretty pointe <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/flats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flats</a>, you’d be hard pressed to find an it-girl that hasn’t leant into the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/ballet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">balletcore</a> trend this year. </p>

<p>And the autumn/winter 2023 runways boasted many a ballet-inspired take, with designers including Simone Rocha, Molly Goddard and Sandy Liang setting the barre with pretty hair ribbons, ballerina slippers and swoon-worthy sheer tulle dresses. But it was a certain pair of pink ribbon-tied buckled ballerina pumps, debuted by Miu Miu back in 2016, that truly reaffirmed our love of the shoe.

<p>Meanwhile, All Saints has recently dropped a dreamy <a href="https://www.allsaints.com/women/edits/royal-ballet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dance-inspired collaboration </a>with the Royal Ballet, inviting four members from the renowned company’s troupe to select their six favourite pieces from their recent collection.</p>
<p>It’s a looser take on the ballerina affair, with elevated staples — more for the ‘off-duty’ dancer who traipses from home to her studio in an oversized hoody, high-impact boots and heavy-duty biker jackets.</p>
<p>“To be a ballet dancer you have to have such strength and we are a strong brand,” Catherine Jobling Scorey, COO at All Saints, tells <i>Stylist</i>. “To me there is nothing cooler than a classic tutu dressed with a cool leather biker jacket.” </p>
<p>If you’re looking to nail the trend from top to toe, look no further than <i>Stylist</i>’s edit of the best ballet-inspired styles to shop. From tights, leg warmers, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/best-wrap-cardigans-autumn-winter/425338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrap cardigans</a> and a whole load of ballet <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/embellished-flats-shoes/813350" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flats</a>, these are all the essentials you’ll need to help perfect your plié.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It doesn’t matter how brilliant you are at your job, you will, at some point, make a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/less-productive-friday-afternoons/810848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mistake</a>. It’s inevitable. Mess-ups come for us all. Your mistake might be tiny (a ‘reply all’ to an email, for example) or it could be a mighty wrong, but you can rest assured, there will be a moment where you err. </p>
<p>The key to success is not in trying to avoid mistakes at all costs (because that’s impossible – nobody’s perfect), but in apologising readily and bouncing back swiftly. That not only requires releasing your pride, but also the ability to deliver a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/how-to-apologise-work/814686" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">really good apology</a>. </p>
<p>The good news is that this is an ability you can absolutely pick up. Not sure where to start? Communications expert Matt Abrahams recommends something he calls the AAA technique. </p>
<p>“Saying sorry might seem like a straightforward thing, but there’s a bit of an art to it,” Abrahams notes. “Today, we’re breaking down a simple yet super-effective formula that can help you ace your apology game – the AAA technique. Think of it as your go-to toolkit for fixing things up and smoothing over those little bumps.</p>
<p>“In a nutshell, the AAA method is your ticket to saying sorry in a way that actually means something. It might not be a one-size-fits-all thing, but Acknowledge, Appreciate and Amends are the secret sauce for crafting apologies that fix things up and keep your connections strong.”</p>
<p>Here’s how to do the AAA method.</p>
<h2><\h2><p>“First off, we need to own up to our blunders,” says Abrahams. “No beating around the bush here. It’s time to point out exactly what we did wrong and take full responsibility without any fancy footwork.</p>
<p>“So, instead of saying something like, ‘sorry if what I said offended you’, let’s get real with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘My bad for waiting until the last minute to test the system. I know it messed with our workflow.’</li>
<li>‘I shouldn’t have called out your commitment in front of everyone. I’m sorry for making you look bad.’</li>
</ul>
<p>“Cut the jargon and get straight to the point—that’s the ticket!”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>Have a think about exactly how your mistake has impacted other people and make it clear that you understand this. Make reference to the emotions at play, not just what happened. </p>
<p>“We’re talking about putting ourselves in their shoes and realising the emotional toll our blunders took,” Abrahams explains. “Avoid downplaying the impact. Instead of saying, ‘it’s not a big deal’, let’s be real:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘The software upgrade mess definitely ate into your work time, and I feel bad about it.’</li>
<li>‘Calling you out like that? I get it now – it made you look bad. My bad for real.’</li>
</ul>
<p>“Feel their feelings and let them know you get why they’re upset.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>“Now comes the part where we talk about what we’re going to do to make things right,” Abrahams concludes. “It’s not just about saying sorry; it’s about showing you’re serious about making things better.</p>
<p>“Skip the vague promises and get specific:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘To avoid this mess again, I’m committing to testing the system an hour before our demos, starting next week.’ </li>
<li>‘If I’ve got issues with your work, I’ll talk to you privately from now on. No more public call-outs.’</li>
</ul>
<p>“Concrete steps show you’re not just talking the talk; you’re walking the walk.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two types of people in the world: those for whom the mere mention of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/small-talk-work-tips/563958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small talk</a>&nbsp;inspires dread and despair, and those who take to it like a duckling to a warm bath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you fall into the former camp, it’s quite frustrating that the act of small talk seems to make up so much of our workplace interactions. An ability to have a chit-chat can feel more essential than Excel skills; it’s a necessity for landing a job, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/how-to-network-successfully/529916" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">networking</a>, getting a promotion, getting in your boss’s good books… the list goes on and on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We tend to think of the gift of the gab as something innate, but the truth is that having good chat is a skill that can be built. How, you may ask? That’s where Matt Abrahams comes in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Abrahams is a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, the author of <i><a href="https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/matt-abrahams/think-faster-talk-smarter/9781035024957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Think Faster, Talk Smarter: How to Speak Successfully When You’re Put on the Spot</a></i> and <i><a href="https://he.kendallhunt.com/product/speaking-without-freaking-out-50-techniques-confident-and-compelling-presenting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking Up Without Freaking Out</a></i>, and the host of <i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6ll0MwobDt1JW9gYaOONEo?si=516657a5ea02494e&nd=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast</a></i>. In short, he is the true expert when it comes to communication in the world of work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“In the intricate dance of social interactions, the ability to engage in meaningful small talk&nbsp;– or as some like to call it, schmoozing&nbsp;– can be a game-changer,” he tells <i>Stylist</i>. “Whether you’re navigating a networking event, mingling at a party or just striking up a conversation with a colleague, mastering the art of schmoozing can open doors and create lasting connections.”</p>
<p>Abrahams says there are five simple rules to great small talk, which he shares ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><\h2><p>Abrahams says: “You know that person who can’t stop talking about themselves? Yeah, don’t be that person. The key to successful small talk is putting the spotlight on the other party. People love to share their stories, so let them. Ask open-ended questions, listen actively, and show genuine interest. Trust me, when you make it about them, you become the person everyone wants to talk to.”</p>
<p>This approach can also help you deal with nerves. When you’re feeling anxious about how you’re coming across, switch the focus to the other person. Think about how you can make <i>them </i>feel more comfortable, and you’ll often find that your own discomfort slips away. </p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><\h2><p>It’s tempting to prep a list of icebreakers and fun facts so you’ll feel more prepared for a big socialising session, but this isn’t the way to form a genuine connection. Instead, go in with some topics in mind and curate the structure of your conversation to make the other person feel heard. </p>
<p>“My favorite formula for this is What, So What, Now What,” Abrahams recommends. “Start with a point or argument (What), add significance to it (So What), and suggest a course of action or inquire about theirs (Now What). It’s like a mini storytelling session that keeps the conversation flowing and engaging. Craft your content and you’ll never be at a loss for words.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>“Let’s be real – the standard ‘how are you?’ can lead to the most yawn-inducing loop of conversations,” says Abrahams. “Break free from the mundane! When initiating small talk, skip the clichés. </p>
<p>“Comment on the environment, share a quirky observation or ask about their thoughts on a relevant topic. Be the conversation starter who adds a spark to the chat. Trust me; it’s way more interesting than the usual script.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>No one wants to be stuck in a chat with someone that just won’t end. The answer is not just pretending you need the loo or darting your eyes around the room hoping to spot someone you recognise. Instead, try the ‘white flag’ approach. </p>
<p>“This is all about leaving on a high note,” Abrahams explains. “Express gratitude for the conversation, show you’ve been engaged, and end with a thoughtful question. It could be about their experiences, opinions, or even recommendations. This way, you’re not just exiting; you’re leaving a positive and lasting impression.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>“Here’s a secret: nobody’s perfect, especially in small talk,” says Abrahams. “Embrace the imperfections, and you’ll feel the weight lift off your shoulders. Small talk is a two-way street; it’s not just about what you say but how you make others feel. If you stumble on your words or say something offbeat, laugh it off. Small talk is about building connections, not delivering a flawless monologue. Be authentic, be yourself and watch the magic happen.”</p>

You might have spent the past few months chest pressing and deadlifting in your living room, but suddenly, you’re faced with way more weight options. The key to overcoming gym anxiety is to have a plan in place before you even step through the front door – but if you’re not sure which weights to go for, that can be a little difficult. </p>
<p>To help make that decision a little easier, we’ve roped in PTs Alice Miller and Zara Ozard who know all about creating a sustainable, effective gym regime. Not sure where to begin on your weight lifting journey, or how to translate your home practice in the weights room? Keep on reading…</p>
<h2><\h2><p>“For most people, choosing the right weight will require a little trial and error,” says Ozard. “I always say that the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/lift-heavier-weights/537920" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weight you’re lifting should be challenging</a> but doable. If your form is being compromised during both the lifting and lowering phase, then that would suggest that you’re lifting too heavy.”</p>
<p>She suggests choosing a weight that allows you to work for eight-to-12 reps per set, and which leaves your muscles feeling fatigued during the last couple of reps. “You might do your first set and know that you could get more out, in which case add some weight on for your next set. It’s also great to write things down so you can remember where you were last time and pick your weight accordingly.”</p>

<p>Miller agrees with Ozard that it’s really a personal choice. “It depends on how long you’ve been training, if you’ve taken breaks, if you’ve got injuries and what your goals are. If you are completely new, I would focus on getting used to using dumbbells. They are a great way to start out on your lifting journey. </p>
<p>“You want to make sure that you’re not lifting so heavy that you can’t control your form, but also need to lift something that feels challenging. A 2kg dumbbell is probably lighter than your backpack, so don’t be shy about trying heavier!”</p>
<h2><\h2><p><span style="font-size: 18px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);">Now, you might think that weight trianing is all about lifting as heavy as you can – but head to a spin session or pilates class, and you’ll find instructors using really light dumbbells. Both kinds of weights can </span><i style="font-size: 18px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);">burn</i><span style="font-size: 18px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);">, which is better to choose if you’re on your own in the gym?</span></p>
<p>“It depends on the goal but if you’re totally new to training, I’d suggest doing lighter weights for more reps until you have the form perfect, rather than jumping in to heavy weights and injuring yourself,” Ozard says.</p>
<p>“If your goal is strength, choose a weight you can only lift for a maximum of six reps. Muscular endurance, on the other hand, happens around the 15 rep mark, so you’ll need much lighter dumbbells.”</p>
<p>Miller, however, says that she believes “every single person should be lifting heavy”.</p>
<p>That means lifting around 80% of your one rep max – ie the heaviest you could possibly squat just once. If you don’t know what that is yet, then Miller recommends using ‘rate of perceived exertion’, which is an effort ranking between one and 10. “Lifting heavy would probably be an eight, nine or 10, on that scale, with nine being the feeling of ‘that’s really heavy but I could probably do one more rep’ and 10 being ‘I am maxed out, I can’t do anything more’.”</p>
<p>Why so heavy? Miller flags that the body won’t adapt if it’s not being surprised or stressed, so gradually adding more weight every few training sessions is going to help you progress.</p>
<h2><\h2><p>OK, so we’re committed to lifting a little more than usual. But given how important form is, it’s important to know exactly <i>how</i> to lift heavier. </p>
<h3>Go slow</h3>
<p>Miller stresses the importance to gradually getting heavier: “Work on consistency and focus on the basics. That means learning to move well. My advice is to go a little bit slower and so you can really focus on that control. Think about what muscles are being worked when you’re doing it.”</p>
<h3>Remember to breathe</h3>
<p>“Something that people kind of forget about is how powerful your breath is when doing strength work,” she continues. “If you don’t work with your breath and if you’re not creating tension in your body, you’re not going to be able to lift as much. All the great strength coaches are going to teach you about intra-abdominal pressure and creating that tension in the midline.”</p>
<h3>Be consistent</h3>
<p>Ozard says that “you also need to be training quite regularly, but also with enough time out to rest and recover”.</p>
<h3>Focus on your core</h3>
<p>“Having a strong core is also important because when we lift everything comes from the core,” Ozard concludes.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>As an Academy Award-winner and the much-loved star of <i>The Princess Diaries</i>, <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i> and <i>Interstellar</i>, it’s hard to believe that <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/anne-hathaway" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anne Hathaway</a> could be thought of as anything other than entertainment royalty.</p>
</div>
<p>But in a recent interview with <i>Porter</i>, the actor recalled that when she first started out in Hollywood, she was told that her career wouldn’t last. “I was warned that my career would fall off a cliff at the age of 35, which is something I know a lot of women face,” she explained. </p>
<p>In an industry where <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/ageism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ageism</a>, particularly towards women, remains rife, it’s saddening but not surprising. <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/halle-berry-ageism-body-shaming-response/778250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halle Berry</a> is constantly standing up to age-shamers online, while <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/people/naomi-watts-hollywood-sexism-unfuckable-age-40/714540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Naomi Watts</a> has gone public about being told she needed to achieve as much as possible in her acting career before becoming “unfuckable” over the age of 40. </p>
<p>However, as 41-year-old Hathaway pointed out,  an increasing number of women in the industry are now (thankfully) enjoying longer careers than in the past.</p>
<p>“The thing that has evolved during (that time) is that more women are having careers deeper into their lives, which I think is fantastic,” she shared. “Obviously, it doesn’t mean we should have a ticker-tape parade – someone said this to me the other day: ‘There’s so much to be proud of and there’s so much to fix.’”</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Anne Hathaway" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2022/11/03132335/gettyimages-1423675063-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Hathaway opened up about having “always been really upfront about being an <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/ambition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ambitious</a> person”, adding, “I have <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/goals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goals</a>, I have dreams; they don’t look much different than they did when I was (younger), but I’m still pursuing them.”</p>
<p>A masterclass in never giving up if we’ve ever seen one. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From political turbulence to the climate crisis and the rising cost of living, 2023 has been a challenging year to say the least. The state of the world has left us frustrated, anxious and, frankly, exhausted, meaning that as we approach <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/christmas-how-to-talk-to-family-about-anxiety-depression/338230" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas</a> and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/new-years-eve-make-up-ideas/745550" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Year</a>, finding time to truly wind down is key. </p>
<p>Luckily, there is one Dutch lifestyle trend that is all about  tackling the increasing levels of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/what-is-stress-physical-symptoms-workplace-burnout-advice/322177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stress</a> and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/mouth-ulcers-run-down-burnout/746160" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">burnout</a> felt by modern generations and taking time to chill out.</p>
<p>Picked up by <a href="https://time.com/5622094/what-is-niksen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Time Magazine</i></a>, Niksen is a word used by the Dutch to encapsulate the combined feeling and activity of doing absolutely nothing, with zero levels of purpose. Now, it doesn’t have to mean sitting still exactly but is used for those times when your mind wanders, you may be pottering about at home, taking your time and without the burden of feeling like you need to achieve anything.</p>
<p>Although the Netherlands has obviously been using the word for hundreds of years, it seems like the perfect time for it to migrate over to the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/food-drink/restaurants-bars/cool-restaurants-in-uk/743368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK</a>, as <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/worry-burnout-signs-symptoms-recovery/742620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">burnout</a> becomes a growing problem.</p>
<p class="">Not to be confused with <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/anxiety-when-sick-ill-cold-flu/586996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anxiety</a> or <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/christmas-depression-how-to-cope/331095" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">depression</a>, burnout is a state of extreme stress when the body goes into auto-pilot, leaving you feeling like a robot. It can creep up on us slowly, masked by a sense of ‘we’re all busy though, aren’t we?’ and seems to be a particularly <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/argos-catalogues-70s-80s-90s-childhood-millennial-christmas-nostalgia/178934" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">millennial</a> problem, caused essentially by taking on too much and a need to high performing at everything. </p>
<p>Niksen, by contrast, celebrates the joy of doing nothing and letting the world glide on past. Like a form of self-care, by practising niksen it is thought that we give our minds and bodies the chance to really, truly unwind.</p>
<p>How you ‘niks’ is up to you, and the joy of being idle is a very personal thing, so it’s unlikely that you’ll relish doing nothing in the same way as a friend. Below, though, we’ve picked out four ways you can start practicing some niksen time if you’re not sure how to get started. </p>
<p><b>Sit by a window and just stare</b></p>
<p>No, seriously. The act of just curling up in a chair and sitting for a minute, with nowhere to be and nothing to do is exactly what niksen is all about. This is even better done when there’s a window to look out of, so that you can literally sit and watch the world go by. </p>
<p><b>Lie on your bed and listen to music</b></p>
<p>Niksen should be nothing if not comfortable, and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/long-reads/science-why-we-love-lie-in-bed-sleep-weekends/262489" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is there a more comfortable place than bed?</a> We’d be hard pushed to find one if there is. Lying back and just letting your mind wander, with some of your favourite tunes on in the background is a great way to unfurl from the stress of your day. Don’t feel guilty about doing nothing, just enjoy doing nothing.  </p>
<p><b>Go for a walk </b></p>
<p>Now when we say go for a walk, we don’t mean anywhere in particular, the point of niksen is to achieve absolutely nothing. So if you have some spare time, or better yet, you’ve set aside some time to niksen, then why not take a stroll to nowhere, in particular, to clear your mind and just be.</p>
<p><b>Do something with your hands like knitting or a jigsaw</b></p>
<p>Again, we’re not asking you to work hard on a knitting pattern to whip up a new scarf for your great-aunt. This act of just doing something with your hands should feel almost therapeutic like you’re just doing it for the sake of it without a wider agenda.  </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With December fast approaching, it’s almost time to get in the festive mood. Soon enough, we’ll be pulling out the advent calendars, putting up the fairy lights and throwing on our comfiest jumpers. The final ingredient? A cosy <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/christmas-films" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">festive flick</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, we all know and love the classics, from <i>Elf </i>and <i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/love-actually" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Love Actually</a></i> to <i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/the-holiday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Holiday</a>. </i>However, if you’ve already watched and rewatched all of the holiday staples, you may be in the mood for something new. </p>
<p>So, here are eight brand new wintry films to keep an eye out for this season.</p>
<h2><i>Best. Christmas. Ever!</i></h2>
<p>This is already a classic in the making: starring Brandy, singer and star of cult classic <i>Cinderella</i>, and 00s icon Heather Graham, <i>Best. Christmas. Ever! </i>follows two old friends, Jackie (Brandy) and Charlotte (Graham), who find themselves spending Christmas together along with their two families when Charlotte sets out to prove that her old friend’s seemingly picture-perfect life can’t be as idyllic as it appears.</p>
<p><i>Best. Christmas. Ever! </i>will be streaming on Netflix from 16 November.</p>
<h2><i>Candy Cane Lane</i></h2>
<p>Starring comedy legend Eddie Murphy and <i>black-ish’s</i>&nbsp;Tracee Ellis Ross, <i>Candy Cane Lane</i>&nbsp;promises to be old-school festive comedy fare. The film follows Chris Carver (Murphy), who makes a deal with a magical elf to win his neighbourhood Christmas decoration context. However, when the elf turns out to be evil, he has to find a way to stop her (and probably save Christmas in the process).</p>
<p><i>Candy Cane Lane</i>&nbsp;will be streaming on Prime Video from 1 December.</p>
<h2><i>Your Christmas Or Mine 2</i></h2>
<p>Sequel alert: <i>Your Christmas Or Mine 2</i> follows James (Asa Butterfield) and Hayley (Cora Kirk). who are gearing up for their second Christmas as a couple. And that can only mean one thing… mayhem with their families. </p>
<p>This time around, James’ dad has invited the family to spend Christmas in a luxury ski resort in the Austrian Alps, so they can meet his new American girlfriend (played by Jane Krakowski). However, Hayley’s dad Geoff insisted on handling his family’s side of the booking and something clearly got lost in translation. After a mix-up with transport at the airport, the two tribes end up at each other’s accommodations, on different sides of a valley and opposite ends of the Tripadvisor ratings scale. Can Hayley and James’ relationship survive another turbulent family Christmas, or has their future together gone off-piste?</p>
<p><i>Your Christmas Or Mine 2 </i>will launch on Friday 8 December on Prime Video.</p>
<h2><i>The Velveteen Rabbit</i></h2>
<p>OK, get ready to feel very, very nostalgic, because the famous children’s story <i>The Velveteen Rabbit</i> is finally getting a live-action adaptation. Margery Williams’s story tells the tale of a stuffed rabbit made of velveteen, who, after being given to a little boy for Christmas, dreams of becoming a real rabbit – something that can only happen when his owner’s love for him is real. You’ll hear the voices of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/helena-bonham-carter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helena Bonham-Carter</a>, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/nicola-coughlan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicola Coughlan</a>, Alex Lawther and Paterson Joseph as the toys, while the mother is played by Samantha Colley.</p>
<p><i>The Velveteen Rabbit </i>will be streaming on Apple TV+ from 22 November.</p>
<h2><i>The Holdovers</i></h2>
<p>An acclaimed Christmas comedy, <i>The Holdovers</i> is set in a 1970s New England boarding school, where strict history teacher Paul (Paul Giamatti) is left to take care of four ‘holdover’ students over Christmas, while the rest of the school returns home for the holidays. Although Paul tries to run a tight ship, things soon go awry.</p>
<p><i>The Holdovers</i> is coming to cinemas on 19 January 2024.</p>
<h2><i>Family Switch</i></h2>
<p>The swapping places comedy is a whole subgenre of its own, with classics like <i>Freaky Friday, The Parent Trap </i>and <i>The Princess Switch.</i> Now, there’s a new addition with <i>Family Switch</i>, which sees <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/jennifer-garner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Garner</a> and Ed Helms playing two parents who switch places with their children, played by Brady Noon and <i></i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/tv/netflix-wednesday-addams-live-action-series-tim-burton/486575"><i>Wednesday’s</i> Emma Myers</a>. To make matters more exciting, the mystical switch takes place right before the holidays. Any opportunity to see Jennifer Garner playing a 13-year-old stuck in the body of an adult, sign us up.</p>
<p><i>Family Switch</i> will be streaming on Netflix from 30 November.</p>
<h2><i>Dashing Through the Snow</i></h2>
<p>Coming to Disney+ this season, <i>Dashing Through the Snow</i> is a comedy fantasy about a man who hates Christmas after a difficult childhood. When he and his daughter meet a man called ‘Nick’ on Christmas Eve, things soon take a magical twist.</p>
<p><i>Dashing Through the Snow </i>is streaming from 17 November.</p>
<h2><i>What Happens Later</i></h2>
<p>Finally, we’ve got <i>What Happens Later</i>, a brand new romcom starring and directed by <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/film/best-meg-ryan-roles-romantic-comedies/831640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meg Ryan</a>, the queen of the genre. Ryan and David Duchovny play exes who run into each other during the holidays at an airport. Stuck together overnight, the pair finally gets the chance to discuss what happened between them. </p>
<p><i>What Happens Later</i> hit cinemas in October 2023. Its streaming release has yet to be announced.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often find yourself daydreaming? Your eyes <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/daydreaming-work-productivity/251658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drifting away from your computer screen</a> or the dirty dishes in front of you as you lose yourself in an indulgent fantasy? The good news is, a little daydreaming is completely normal. In fact, it can even be <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/six-ways-daydreaming-makes-you-happier/739548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good for you</a>. But why are some people more prone to it than others? And what does it mean if you have daydreams that you can’t seem to control?</p>
<p>According to a new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886922005748?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> from researchers in Toyko, having a tendency to daydream may actually be linked to your curiosity or to your anxiety. Or maybe even to both!</p>
<h2>About the study</h2>
<p>Researchers conducted two separate studies to examine how curiosity and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/mental-reset-for-anxiety/786981" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anxiety</a> both play a part in how (and when) we daydream.</p>
<p>In the first study, they surveyed 260 students to find out about their daydreaming habits, their <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/one-good-thing-get-curious/808280" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">curiosity type</a>, and their anxiety levels. They found that people with anxiety were more likely to drift off into daydreams without being able to control the mind’s wandering. </p>
<p>The second study looked more closely at diversive curiosity (the type of curiosity that leads people to be interested in a wide range of subjects). Similarly, the study found that people who were more curious about diverse topics found themselves daydreaming both on purpose and by accident more frequently. In individuals with anxiety, the levels of accidental daydreaming were higher.</p>
<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<p>So, what does all of this mean? Well, firstly, it suggests that your daydreaming patterns might hint at both your curiosity and your anxiety levels. It’s important to note that controllable daydreaming (daydreaming that you <i>decide </i>to do) is not a strong indicator of anxiety. However, if you often find yourself drifting off into daydreams unintentionally, it might be linked to heightened anxiety. But, it also might suggest you simply have a very active, curious mind.</p>
<p>If you’re struggling with feelings of anxiety or with uncontrollable daydreaming, it’s always recommended to speak to a mental health professional who can help. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I tap on my Instagram and go to <i>Blocked Accounts</i>, and there her account appears. She is smiling, head tilted and framed in a perfect circle. A green dot glowing towards the bottom left tells me she is currently active. This is my estranged mother; I haven’t spoken to her in years. </p>
<p>I am at peace with this arrangement, and I believe she is too.  But many onlookers are not. Maternal estrangement makes them feel uncomfortable. ‘But she’s your mum…’, ‘You’ve only got one’ and ‘Oh, you two will reconnect at some point’ are the usual responses. The implication is that this is a situation that requires fixing and reconciliation is the only remedy.</p>
<p>I’m one of many adult daughters who are estranged from their mothers. We are a silent group, but a cohort that could be on the rise. Up to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4507819/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10% of mothers</a> are estranged from at least one adult child, with academic researchers and therapists saying that they’re witnessing a ‘<a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20211201-family-estrangement-why-adults-are-cutting-off-their-parents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">silent epidemic</a>’ of family breakups more generally. In the UK, the charity Stand Alone estimates that <a href="https://www.standalone.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/StandAlonePrevalenceRESEARCH3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one in five families</a> will be touched by family estrangement and its consequences. </p>

<h4>I wish there was more compassion and less judgment</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>It’s a group that Dr Joshua Coleman, a clinical psychologist and the author of <a href="https://www.sheldonpress.co.uk/titles/joshua-coleman-6/rules-of-estrangement/9781529350845/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Rules Of Estrangement</i></a>, suspects is growing. “There’s a rise due to a number of factors. In the past half-century or so, there was an institutional framework that guided families, such as the church, gender, marriage and your neighbourhood. You had this idea that you should ‘honour thy mother, honour thy father’ and respect your elders. This has given way to a much more identitarian perspective about family living that is much more constituted around: <i>what will make me happy? What’s in alignment with my ideals? </i>Add to that <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/divorce/bulletins/divorcesinenglandandwales/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increasing divorce rates</a>, rising rates of individualism in Western societies and social media fanning the flames, and all of these things make families more at risk of estrangement.” </p>
<p>The mother-daughter estrangement, of all the family dyads, says Coleman, is “potentially the most fraught. Female identities are often more socialised towards relationship building and can carry more feelings of guilt and responsibility. So I think for daughters there can be a greater feeling of shame about it.”</p>
<p>It’s by no means unique to mothers and daughters. “Men get pressured to reconcile, but the pressure women experience is enormous,” says Helena Smith*. “My mother and I were estranged on and off for many years before our final estrangement three years before she died. I kept trying to make things right between us. I was also the one who made the decision to be estranged in the end. Quite honestly, by the time I did that, after decades of painful experiences, it came as a huge relief. It got rid of a huge ongoing source of anxiety and pain in my life. It brought me a level of peace. Of course, I was still sad about the fact that we couldn’t have a relationship; I still wished we could. But when I finally let go of actively working to ‘fix’ it, I felt better than I had in many years.” </p>

<h4>I don’t grieve the loss of a relationship I never had</h4>
<p>Zoe Louise</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>The commentary around ‘But she’s your mum’ feels loaded, like it’s heavy with gendered stigma. Swap it with ‘dad’ and it doesn’t have the same bite. “It baffles me because people will always say ‘But she’s your mum’, but you would never say ‘But they’re your abuser’ to someone,” says Zoe Louise, who is estranged from her mother. “I wish there was more compassion and less judgment.”</p>
<p>This idea of a mother as your ‘best friend’ is written in our greeting cards, Instagram captions and film scripts: ’<i>Like mother, like daughter</i>’, ‘<i>First my daughter, forever my friend</i>’. But it’s far from reality for many, says Becca Bland, a specialist coach in family estrangement. “These relationships can be damaging to one’s health and wellbeing. It can be impossible to imagine that a mother is unloving or uncaring. Yet women are humans and many will bring their unresolved pain and trauma into motherhood.”  </p>
<p>“Perhaps it is the mythology of the mother figure that I feel is missing in my life rather than the reality. A big part of my journey has been grieving the mother I never had and accepting the mother I did get,” says Bland.</p>
<p>This maternal archetype can compound feelings of shame when your lived experience is just not the same. It feels like the ultimate taboo to admit. It’s the thing you try to swerve past on first dates or when you’re getting to know colleagues and friends. Even if you try to be open, just saying the word ‘estranged’ feels hard to get out of your throat. It can leave you reeling afterwards, fearing judgment. It keeps your mind whirring – <i>Did I really do the right thing? Am I a bad person?</i> – and feels like you’re hoarding a terrible secret.</p>
<p>What Dr Joshua Coleman is keen to emphasise is that estrangement can look very different for different people. There isn’t one blueprint. No contact can involve not meeting up physically, but still having a text exchange. It can be reconciling, then pulling away, then reconciling again. It can be no contact at all. It can be limiting meet-ups to once a year. </p>
<p>For Zoe Louise, her maternal estrangement feels “normal”. “That’s because I’ve never had a close relationship [with my mother]. I don’t really grieve the loss of a relationship I never had. The estrangement occurred as a result of my childhood traumas, specifically her abusive behaviour towards me, which meant that I never had a secure attachment to her. I grew up afraid of my mum; as soon as I gained independence, I left home and never sought out that bond.” </p>
<p>Grieving a mother who is alive comes without a guidebook. There’s no official accepted  process. There’s no absolute like a loss. Both parties have to define their own sense of closure. That can change, and that’s OK. What may be right for one mother-daughter relationship simply isn’t for another. The best course of action is what you make of it. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It may be freezing outside, but your forever fashion friend needn’t be the aged loungewear set you’ve been stationed in for the last two years. </p>
<p>Instead, try swapping out cosy staples for, well, other cosy staples, but more specifically ones that don’t compromise on comfort and add just a touch more flair. </p>
<p>Because while the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/best-denim-dresses/612641" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dresses</a> that currently line your wardrobe are all good and well, they’re not always as comfortable as you may like them to be. Which is exactly where jumper <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/best-new-marks-and-spencer-dresses/614781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dresses</a> come in.  </p>
<p>The dress equivalent of your cuddliest, cosiest and most swaddlicious jumpers, the humble jumper <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/hailey-bieber-style-rixo/532611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dress</a> is not to be overlooked. Instead, it’s to be embraced, particularly on the days where actually thinking about styling an outfit is just too much to handle.</p>
<p>Should you be popping to the shops while wearing yours, pair it with <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/tall-stomper-boots-boot-trends/567645" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high-knee stomper boots</a> for a style set-approved off-duty look, and should you be staying at home, simply layer with tights for the cosy, stylish ensemble of dreams. A jumper dress is a total no-brainer, and these nine are our favourites. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A regular feature in the weekly shop, chicken is always a crowd-pleaser. But if you’re looking for some fresh inspiration – whether it’s for an easy weeknight dish or something to impress at the weekend – we’re turning to chef and food writer Claire Thomson’s latest book, <i><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/4756/9781837830886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One Pan Chicken</a></i>.</p>

<p>Featuring over 70 recipes – all of which make the humble chicken the star of the show, from wings and thighs to whole birds – the dishes promise to suit any day, season and occasion, ranging from slow-cooked meals and hearty roasts perfect for the depths of winter to speedy mid-week options and everything in between. And the best part? Every recipe is made using only one pan. Be it a casserole dish, roasting tray or frying pan, they guarantee maximum flavour, with minimum fuss and washing up. </p>
<p>To get you started, we’re sharing three easy recipes from the book that are here to make your weeknights easier (and more delicious) than ever.

<h4 class="listicle__title">Chicken with cannellini beans, tomatoes, cream and dijon mustard</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p><b>Claire says: </b>“Chicken breasts work best for this recipe, though you can use thighs or legs instead. Cannellini beans are one of my favourite beans to cook with – a creamy canvas of flavour, the beans soaking up everything this recipe has to offer. This dish also freezes well.”</p>
<p><i>Serves 4</i></p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1kg (2lb 4oz) whole skin-on chicken breasts, thighs, legs or drumsticks</li>
<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>250g (9oz) cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
<li>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
<li>30g (1oz) butter</li>
<li>150ml (5fl oz) dry white wine</li>
<li>200ml (7fl oz) double (heavy) cream</li>
<li>1½ tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
<li>2 x 400g (14oz) cans of cannellini (white) or butter beans, drained and rinsed</li>
<li>a big pinch of ground nutmeg</li>
<li>1 small bunch of tarragon, or use flat-leaf</li>
<li>parsley or basil, leaves roughly chopped</li>
<li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Method</b></p>
<p>Season the chicken with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Heat the oil in a casserole pan over a moderate–high heat, add the chicken and brown all over for about 5 minutes each side, until coloured and beginning to cook through. Then, add the tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes more until the tomatoes are soft and collapsed. Stir in the garlic and the butter and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant.</p>
<p>Add the white wine and cook for 5 minutes, until the liquid in the pan has thickened, turning the chicken every now and then.</p>
<p>Add the cream, Dijon mustard, beans and nutmeg and stir to combine. Season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper. When the mixture begins to bubble around the edges, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10–15 minutes, turning the chicken every now and then, until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through.</p>
<p>Check the seasoning, adding a touch more salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste, then stir through the herbs. Serve immediately.</p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">Chicken with orzo, artichokes, oregano and feta</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p><b>Claire says:</b> “I am looking to Greece for the flavours used in this one-pot. Orzo is the phantom pasta shape that likes to think it is rice. In this recipe it is cooked with tomatoes, chicken stock, plenty of cracked coriander seeds, oregano and more, then strewn all over with an unbeatable trio of feta, artichokes and parsley. Serve with some lemon wedges on the side to squeeze all over.”</p>
<p><i>Serves 4</i></p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b><i><br /></i></p>
<ul>
<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>1 red (bell) pepper, deseeded and finely diced</li>
<li>1 onion, finely diced</li>
<li>3 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
<li>2 tsp coriander seeds, roughly crushed</li>
<li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
<li>1 tsp sweet or hot unsmoked paprika</li>
<li>½ tsp salt</li>
<li>250g (9oz) passata (strained tomatoes)</li>
<li>700g (1lb 9oz) boneless, skinless chicken (thigh is best), diced</li>
<li>300g (10½oz) orzo pasta</li>
<li>250ml (9fl oz) hot chicken stock or boiling water</li>
<li>200g (7oz) feta, crumbled </li>
<li>about 150g (5½oz) artichokes in oil, drained and roughly diced</li>
<li>½ small bunch of dill, roughly chopped</li>
<li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 lemon, quartered, to serve</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Method</b></p>
<p>Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed casserole pan over a moderate heat. Add the (bell) pepper and onion and cook for around 8–10 minutes, until soft. Add the garlic and cook for a further 1–2 minutes, until fragrant.</p>
<p>Add the coriander seeds, dried oregano, paprika and salt and stir for 1 minute, mixing briskly. Add the passata and cook for 2 minutes, then add the chicken and stir well to coat. Continue to cook over a moderate heat for about 5 more minutes.</p>
<p>Add the orzo to the pan along with the hot stock or boiling water and bring the pan to a quick simmer. Cover with a lid, reduce the heat to moderate–low and cook for about 30 minutes, until the orzo is tender and the chicken is cooked through. From time to time, give the pan a good stir as the orzo will try its best to stick to the bottom of the pan. Add a splash more water, if necessary.</p>
<p>Remove from the heat and check the seasoning of the sauce, adding plenty of freshly ground black pepper and a pinch more salt, if necessary, then strew all over with the crumbled feta, diced artichokes and chopped dill. Serve with the lemon quarters on the side.</p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">Chimichurri chicken with roast squash</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p><b>Claire says: </b>“Chimichurri is a pungent green Argentinian sauce made using fresh herbs, vinegar and garlic. In this recipe, I’ve used half the chimichurri to marinate the chicken, and I’ve served the remainder as the accompanying sauce. This way you get double whammy flavour on the chicken – deep and flavoursome to cook, fresh and vibrant to serve. Roasting the squash at the same time as the chicken on the tray is a tremendous match for both chicken and chimichurri and a popular vegetable (fruit!) for asado-style cooking in Argentina.</p>
<p><i>Serves 4</i></p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1kg (2lb 4oz) whole chicken thighs, legs or drumsticks</li>
<li>800g (1lb 12oz) squash, peeled, deseeded and very thinly sliced</li>
<li>2 red onions, thinly sliced</li>
<li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>2 tsp thyme leaves</li>
<li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>For the chimichurri:</p>
<ul>
<li>(or use about 120g/ 11/4oz store-bought)</li>
<li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
<li>2 tbsp white wine or cider vinegar, plus more if needed</li>
<li>juice of ½ lemon</li>
<li>½ tsp chilli flakes</li>
<li>1 small bunch of flat-leaf parsley</li>
<li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
<li>70ml (21/4fl oz) olive oil, plus more if needed</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Method</b></p>
<p>Blend together all of the ingredients for the chimichurri until smooth, adding salt, plus more vinegar to taste and more oil to loosen, if required.</p>
<p>Mix half the chimichurri into the chicken, cover and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least 1 hour, although the longer the better. Remove the chicken from the fridge about 20 minutes before you plan to cook it. Alternatively, forgo the marinating time and continue with the method below.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/400°F/Gas 6.</p>
<p>In a large baking tray, combine the squash and onions with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and all the thyme leaves, then season with salt and pepper. Place the chicken on top and drizzle with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and again season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Roast for about 35–40 minutes, or until the chicken is completely cooked and tender. Add more seasoning if needed, then drizzle with the remaining chimichurri to serve.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve all seen – or been – that friend who has to have their phone in their eyeline at all times in case they need to do something work-related. They’ll get out their laptop while lounging on the sofa just to ‘sort some emails’ or nip out of a restaurant to jump on a crisis.</p>
<p>That behaviour is frustrating when it’s self-inflicted, when someone has poor <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/new-job-setting-boundaries-at-work-mental-health/743321" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work-life boundaries</a> or might even be struggling with full-on <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/signs-work-addiction/828328" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work addiction</a>. And it’s tempting to berate your mate with a call to just bloody switch off and stop working. </p>
<p>But it’s tricky when it’s not the choice of the person doing it, but rather their manager. It’s all well and good to say you won’t stay late in the office or check your emails at the weekend, but if your boss is constantly messaging out-of-hours – and expecting a response – those boundaries dissolve like candy floss in a puddle. </p>
<p>In those cases, where you care about work-life balance but your manager clearly doesn’t, what can you do? Is it possible to change their behaviour or are you doomed to be dragged out of balance with them? </p>
<p>Before you resign yourself to a life of always being on call, try these tips. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>As tempting as it may be to assume that your boss is a malevolent demon intent on ruining your evenings and weekends, the reality is likely to be a little different. Before rushing into hating them with all your might, consider why they’re sending you messages with no respect for your time off. </p>
<p>“There are a number of reasons that a manager may message outside work, which include a culture of long hours and pressure from <i>their </i>manager,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekuacant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ekua Cant</a>, a career coach and trainer at <a href="https://www.beyournumberonecheerleader.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Be Your No.1 Cheerleader</a>, tells <i>Stylist</i>. “It could be that the manager has micromanaging tendencies and always wants to be in control rather than delegating and trusting. It may be that they are a new manager and feeling insecure, so messaging outside of work makes them feel more reassured that they have all the details and that things are under control. Or they may not even realise what they are doing is intrusive because they habitually work outside hours and think it’s normal.”</p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><\h2><p>Ever heard of positive reinforcement? If each time someone does something, they’re rewarded as a result (whether that’s with a tasty treat or attention), they’ll keep doing it. When your boss messages you on a Sunday night… do you do what they want and complete whatever task they’ve asked of you? If so… they’re going to keep doing the same behaviour, because they know it’s rewarded. </p>
<p>“Don’t assume that messaging outside of working hours is malicious, or even conscious,” notes career coach <a href="https://bethstallwood.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beth Stallwood</a>. “Your boss is probably under more pressure than you realise and might not have stopped to consider the impact of their behaviour. Also, they might well have taken your replies as permission to keep doing it.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>“We’ve all had to work late at some point in our careers to prepare for an important meeting or presentation, but if your boss regularly tries to reach you outside working hours, it can be draining and should be addressed,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlotte-davies-14b49033/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlotte Davies</a>, careers expert at LinkedIn, tells us. “Responding can create an unhealthy expectation of constant availability, blurring the lines between our professional and personal lives and have a significant impact on our mental health and job satisfaction.</p>
</p>
<p>“Setting clear boundaries and pushing back in these scenarios can be difficult, but crucial if you want to avoid burnout further down the line. Open communication and mutual respect are key to a healthy work-life dynamic.</p>
<p>“If the issue persists, have an open conversation with your manager about the impact of after-hours messages on your work-life balance and wellbeing. Make sure to come prepared with instances where you received out-of-hours messages and explain how it made you feel.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>A Slack status that declares you’re in the woods with no signal (even if you’re horizontal on the sofa in full possession of excellent wifi); an out-of-office that’s set for the second 5pm hits; automatic replies that reiterate your working hours – all of these are excellent tools in your arsenal, so use them. </p>
<p>“Set an out-of-office message that states your boundary clearly but not passive-aggressively,” Stallwood recommends. “Something like ‘Thanks for your email. My working hours are 9am to 6.30pm. If your email is urgent, please call me. Otherwise, you can expect a response on my next working day.’ Also, be aware that this probably isn’t a one-and-done situation. You are going to need to keep talking about this problem and checking in on it regularly.”</p>

<h2><\h2><p>“To navigate this situation it is important to reply and let them know you are not at work right now and that you will respond the following day in during working hours,” Cant says. “Do that a couple of times and then do not respond to further messages.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>Refusing to reply to messages and ensuring your status is set to ‘away’ will only go so far. If you find your manager is still bombarding you with communication when you’re not working, you will need to have a chat where you clearly ask them to quit it. </p>
<p>Cant advises going into this conversation with solutions in mind. “After this happens a few times and you can see a pattern, it is helpful to raise it in your 1-2-1 meeting and communicate to your manager how sending these messages is making you less productive at work,” she explains. “Talk with your manager about how you can put in place systems, guides or provide updates in work time that negate the need for messages outside of work time. Alternative suggestions include sending your manager an email or message with any key updates before you leave the office for the day.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>There will be times when actually, you do want your boss to message you even if you’re not working – in a genuine emergency, for example, or perhaps when it’s to do with a project you’re really keen to be involved with. Don’t panic that asserting a boundary about this means you’re banning your manager from ever contacting you. Instead, be clear about what you need and how this may change in different scenarios. </p>
<p>“Have a grown-up conversation with your boss and talk about the need for some boundaries so that you can be at your best during working hours,” Stallwood recommends. “The boundaries you want to set here are what I call ‘bouncy boundaries’, in which you get to decide what’s OK, what you do need to respond to and what can wait. Maybe there are days or times it’s OK to message late, and others that aren’t. It has to work for you.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>You might be reading this feeling guilty about your out-of-hours communication ways. Or perhaps you’re mildly outraged by the idea that your team might not like this. </p>
<p>If so, please heed the following advice. </p>
<p>Cant says: “If you’re the manager and you keep sending messages outside of work time, consider how you can get the information that you need during work time and what’s driving you to do this. Remember that as a manager you also have a responsibility to support the health and wellbeing of yourself and your team members. This may also be an opportunity for you to consider your own work-life balance and where you can make improvements. </p>
<p>“Remember that we all make mistakes. So if you recognise this in yourself, be vulnerable, ask for feedback and be willing to change the way you work. Ask for feedback about how you can work more effectively together with your team. Finally, you may want to seek support from a coach or a therapist to assist you in finding the root cause and building lasting behavioural change, for your personal growth and career development.”</p>
<p>Stallwood adds: “A lot of managers say they don’t expect a response, but most team members want to do a good job and not responding can cause anxiety in itself. Not messaging in the first place demonstrates that you respect people’s lives outside of work, and you’ll get real engagement in return for that. Use the delayed message option in your email app and reserve out-of-hours messaging for actual crises and one-offs.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know how important it is to prioritise our wellbeing – but between busy days at work and responsibilities at home, it can be hard to find the time to truly switch off. Sometimes, you just need to escape the hustle and bustle of your daily routine to fill up your cup.  </p>
<p>Lucky for us, London is home to a bustling wellness scene, with enough studios, spas and wellness centres out there to suit everybody’s taste. </p>
<p>While booking in for a massage or treatment may not be the kind of thing you can afford to do regularly (in which case, a session of self-massage can be the ideal substitute), it’s the perfect way to treat yourself when you’re feeling run down or in need of a pick-me-up.</p>
<p>The difficult bit is choosing where to go, so we’ve put together this guide to some of our favourite wellness spots across the capital to help you get started. From a boutique massage studio in Hackney to a mind gym in Parsons Green, keep reading to check out our picks.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/strength-training-health-benefits/263787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strength training</a> can get pretty complex, especially when it comes to deciding how you structure your workouts. Like most sports, there are multiple ways to approach your training depending on your goals and personal preference – and that includes whether you’re going to prioritise weight or reps.  </p>
<p>While it can be tempting to try to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/lift-heavier-weights/537920#:~:text=The%20best%20way%20to%20do,lift%20it%20off%20the%20ground." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lift as heavy as possible</a>, struggling to complete one rep probably isn’t going to help you build strength in the long run. The same is true on the opposite end of the spectrum: while opting for a weight you can overhead press for hours might make you feel accomplished, it’s probably not going to do much. </p>
<p>Ultimately, you want to find a sweet spot between the two. But does that mean prioritising one over the other, at least to begin with? And if so, how can you tell when it’s time to increase both your weights and your reps? </p>
<h2><\h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="A woman strength training at home" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/08165518/strength-training-reps-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While strength training is all about priming your muscles to support heavier loads, there are benefits to increasing the number of reps you do in a session – including when it comes to endurance and overall fitness. </p>
<p>“Working in a higher rep range helps to improve the ability of your muscles to perform over an extended period,” explains Ali Malik, a personal trainer and founder of <a href="https://www.fitlabskensington.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fit Labs Kensington</a>. “Performing more reps with shorter rest intervals can also elevate your heart rate and enhance cardiovascular conditioning.” </p>
<p>Because increasing your reps typically requires you to drop the amount of weight you’re dealing with, this style of strength training can also provide benefits for joint and ligament health, explains Amanda Place, a personal trainer and founder of <a href="https://www.sculptrition.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculptrition</a>.</p>
<p>“It also helps you to build resilience, not only in your workouts but in various aspects of life, as you have to push through fatigue,” she adds. “Integrating a range of rep schemes into your training can help you to achieve a well-rounded and effective weight training regimen.”</p>
<p>And that’s not forgetting that high-rep routines can also help to reduce the risk of injury that comes with lifting heavier weights, because you’ll be more in control of your movements.  </p>
<h2><\h2><p>There’s something particularly satisfying about being able to up the dumbbell size you use in your workouts, and being ambitious with the weights you use can offer plenty of benefits. That is, if you do it gradually. </p>
<p>“Increasing the weight you are lifting is known in training terms as <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/progressive-overloading-home-gains/472832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">progressive overload</a>,” Malik explains. “This is a fundamental principle in strength training and exercise science that involves gradually increasing the demands placed on your muscles, typically by lifting heavier weights or increasing resistance overtime.” </p>
<p>The benefits associate with this progressive increase in weights are numerous, including increased strength, and muscular hypertrophy, or growth. </p>
<p>It’ll also help you develop power and explosiveness – something you’ll want for sports that require sudden movements – and can even stimulate the development of stronger bones. This is why strength training is such a good form of exercise for women <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/strength-training-hormone-benefits/831003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">both pre- and post-menopause</a>, who are at greater risk of osteoporosis due to their changing hormones.</p>
<p>“Progressive overload also requires increased joint stability and muscle activation, which can help to protect against joint injuries and enhance overall joint health,” Malik adds. </p>
<h2><\h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="A woman picking up a dumbbell at the gym" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/08165534/strength-training-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The right decision for you will largely depend on the goal you’re trying to achieve, as well as the stage you’re at in your training. </p>
<p>Place explains: “If you aim to maximise muscle size and strength, lifting heavier weights with lower repetitions is the preferred approach, as it promotes hypertrophy and significant muscle growth. On the other hand, increasing the number of reps with lighter weights is more effective for improving muscular endurance.” </p>
<p>In most cases, both experts say it’s usually beneficial to incorporate a mix of both approaches into your training. This is a process known as periodisation, where you go through cycles in your training – in this case, it would be training with lower weights and higher reps (known as a hypertrophy or volume phase) and training with heavier weights and lower reps (known as a strength phase). </p>
</p>
<p>A balanced approach can also prevent you from reaching a plateau in your training, which can take a toll on your motivation levels. Ultimately, you just want to make sure you’re always being challenged. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>Want to switch up your strength training, but not sure whether you’re ready to up your reps or weight? Malik recommends considering the following three things: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Are you breezing through your reps? </b></li>
</ul>
<p>“If you are making the deadlifts with ease, you may not be challenging yourself enough,” Malik says. “Every strength training program has specific goals that determine the weight, reps and sets to undertake for each exercise. Hitting the top of your rep range during your sets with proper form can be a sign to go up in weight.” </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Are you seeing results?  </b></li>
</ul>
<p>“The goals set for your strength training class should dictate how heavy you can lift and the way to achieve it,” he says. “There are different ways to achieve your fitness goals other than increasing your weight, such as increasing the number of reps. However, if you have been hitting the gym without much progress, it may be time to consider increasing weight to align with your fitness goals.” </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Is your form flawless? </b></li>
</ul>
<p>“All the weight increase hype may be futile if the body isn’t ready to handle the extra kilos,” Malik explains. “You may need to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/how-to-do-perfect-squat-stronger-glutes/362473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ensure that your form is perfect</a>, allowing you to perform the specific exercise safely. The effects of increasing weight without proper form may result in serious injuries, especially for strength-building exercises that may put a strain on your spine.  </p>
<p>“Having great form allows you to record consistent progress over time. You may choose to record yourself as you do the sets to identify areas you may be doing wrong. Stagnating at the same weight over several weeks can slow down your fitness journey. Knowing when to add weight to your exercises is a critical part of your strength training programme.” </p></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having the opportunity to cancel all your plans and do the bare minimum is one of the only upsides of feeling under the weather, but even that can get a bit boring after a while. After a couple of days, many of us will be itching to get up and move. And as you start to feel better, you might even fancy <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/should-you-exercise-with-a-cold-flu-feeling-ill-sick-doctors-advice-best-workouts/313506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">squeezing in a quick workout</a>.  </p>
<p>The problem with that? Rest is incredibly important when you’re recovering from any kind of illness, so you don’t want to wear yourself out too soon.  </p>
<p>Add to that the fact that many of the symptoms of illness – such as a blocked nose or a chesty cough – can make the process of exercising more challenging than usual, and your 10-minute bodyweight session becomes a recipe for disaster.  </p>
<p>So, how can you tell when you’re finally well enough to get moving? </p>
<p>It’s not an exact science, but many experts recommend using the neck test. It’s nowhere near as clinical or complex as it sounds, and it can be a great way to surmise whether it’s safe to work out with the symptoms you’re dealing with. </p>
<h2><\h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="A woman's neck" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/14101814/woman-neck-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As far as tests go, the neck test must be one of the simplest. It’s a self-assessment you can do at home, so you won’t need any equipment – all you need to do is locate where your symptoms are coming from. You then need to sort them into two groups: above the neck and below the neck. </p>
<p>“If your symptoms are limited to above the neck, such as a runny or stuffy nose, a sore throat or sneezing, it may be safe to engage in light to moderate exercise,” explains <a href="https://linktr.ee/gmhealthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Grace Hula</a>, a GP. “However, if your symptoms are below the neck, such as chest congestion, body aches, fever or gastrointestinal issues, it’s usually best to rest and not exercise.” </p>
<h2><\h2><p>While the neck test is generally effective, it’s important to pay attention to how you’re feeling overall. If you’ve got a snotty nose and unbelievable fatigue, you don’t want to use up all your remaining energy doing a pilates class. </p>
<p>“The neck test can be a useful guideline, but it’s not foolproof and may not work for everyone,” Dr Hula explains. </p>
<p>“It’s important to pay attention to how you feel and use common sense when deciding whether to work out. Additionally, if you have a chronic medical condition, it’s always a good idea to consult with your healthcare provider before exercising when you’re sick.”

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Just because you’ve passed the neck test, it doesn’t mean you want to throw yourself in at the deep end. Your best bet is keeping things low impact. </p>
<p>“When you have a cold or the flu, it’s generally best to opt for light to moderate exercise, such as walking, yoga or gentle stretching,” Dr Hula explains. “These activities can help maintain your mobility, improve circulation and provide a sense of wellbeing without overtaxing your body.” </p>
<p>She continues: “Rest is crucial for recovery, so if you’re unsure about whether to exercise, it’s often safer to err on the side of caution and rest until you’re feeling better.” </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lucy Towers, a first-time mother, went back to work as a freelance journalist and television producer in London when  her daughter, Ottilie, was only a little over three months old. Being self-employed, Lucy had been saving money since she became pregnant, with plans to use her savings to top up the £600 a month maternity allowance  she’d be receiving after giving birth. </p>
<p>But once she was on maternity leave, she found out her savings, which she considered a “healthy” amount, weren’t going to cut it with this year’s rising costs, especially the cost of keeping the house warm enough for her new baby through the winter.</p>
<p>“I was looking at my bank balance and working out how much money I had to live on for the year and alarm bells were ringing,” she said.</p>
<p>While her boyfriend covered the mortgage, Lucy had to make sure their £500 a month bills, not including food, were paid. “I had £100 plus any savings I had every month,” she said. “It wasn’t enough to live on.”</p>
<p>Lucy returned to work, but she now feels guilt for having “lost” months she can’t get back with her daughter. She’s since taken a lower-paid and less pressured job. “I wasn’t physically or mentally able to take on a demanding role,” she said. “My body is still healing. And being a mother to a baby is incredibly tiring. I’m very tired.”</p>

<p>Mothers all over the UK are cutting their maternity leaves short to cope with the soaring costs of living. New research from Pregnant Then Screwed has found that only one in four mothers are able to take their full maternity leave entitlement. </p>
<p>The research sample of 5,165 mothers has looked at the impact of low parental pay on new families, with one in 10 new mums needing to return to work as early as four months after giving birth because they can’t afford to stay off any longer. </p>
<p>“We have some of the lowest rates of parental leave pay in the world,” said Lauren Fabianski, head of campaigns and communications at <a href="https://pregnantthenscrewed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pregnant Then Screwed</a>. “National minimum wage is the legal minimum a person should be paid, yet new mothers are meant to survive on less than half of this amount for 33 weeks, while their outgoings remain the same. It’s an impossible situation for new mothers to be in.”</p>
<p>Currently, statutory maternity leave pay in the UK is paid for up to 39 weeks. Mothers receive 90% of average weekly earnings before tax for the first six weeks. Then it’s £172.48 or 90% of your average weekly earnings (whichever is lower) for the next 33 weeks – this is less than half of the national living wage. For mothers who don’t qualify for statutory maternity pay, they could qualify for maternity allowance, which entitles them to £172.48 or 90% of their average weekly earnings (whichever is lower) for up to 39 weeks.</p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The cost of living crisis has only exacerbated the financial state of new mums, and to cover increasing costs of essentials such as mortgages, rent, food, fuel, clothing, gas and electricity, mums are ending their maternity leaves early.</p>
<p>It was only six weeks after her baby was born that Sarah Louise Lane, a support worker in Herefordshire, headed back to work. “I discovered that since my partner and I receive Universal Credit, any money from maternity allowance would be deducted from our Universal Credit. It cancelled out any increase in income from maternity allowance and left us on one income.”</p>
<p>Then, “overnight”, the cost of living crisis hit, and with four children to feed, Sarah knew that she had to go back to work. “I ended up returning to work as a support worker, bringing my baby with me,” she said. “He was young and slept lots.”</p>
<p>Eventually, she had to change jobs and now works as a nanny so she could work more hours and take her own kids to work, avoiding the price of childcare.</p>
<p>Returning to work early from maternity leave can have a huge impact on the mental and physical health of new mums and their babies, and there are stats to show it already has. NHS data from August 2022 – March 2023 showed an 8% increase in new mothers accessing support for mental health services on the NHS.</p>
<p>“We have also seen an increase in infant mortality in the UK,” said Fabianski. “Poverty has a significant impact on the risk of stillbirth and death during infancy. Ultimately, it is a false economy to not pay parental leave at a rate at which families can survive and thrive and the knock-on effects are lasting.”</p>
<p>Pregnant Then Screwed is hearing from women who, on their return to the workplace, are told by their bosses not to mention that they’d just had a baby when talking to customers. “Like it’s something to be ashamed of,” said Fabianski. “But without proper rates of maternity pay, women are left with no other choice.”</p>
<p>Without intervention, there are concerns from charities working with new mothers that there will be a continued increase in the number of new mothers accessing mental health services and devastating data on infant mortality rates. </p>
<p>“These numbers will continue to rise if we do not support mothers to have the maternity leave that they desperately want,” concluded Fabianski. “If we want a well-functioning society then we need to support the very people that are bringing children into the world. We need to see the rate of statutory parental leave pay increased to meet the national living wage, which is the legal minimum wage a person should be paid to be able to live. Asking mothers to survive on less than half of this amount for 33 weeks is barbaric – and it’s not working.”</p>
<p>A Government spokesperson told <i>Stylist</i>: “We want every child to have the best start in life, which is why have increased Statutory Maternity Pay and Maternity Allowance by over 10% this year.</p>
<p>“Parents who are ready to return to work will benefit from the single biggest investment in childcare in England ever and we’re supporting those who are struggling with record financial support worth around £3,300 per household as we drive down inflation to make everyone’s money go further.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s said that 1% of the world’s population are psychopaths. But what if a psychopath was right beside you? Perhaps a colleague, a friend, a loved one or even your life coach motivating you at your lowest moment?
	  </p>
<p>That’s the topic of Netflix’s gripping new documentary <i>The Psychopath Life Coach,</i> which charts the rise of Lewis Raymond Taylor, founder of multi-million dollar life coaching academy The Coaching Masters.</p>
<h3>What is the true story behind <i>The Psychopath Life Coach</i>?</h3>
<p>Haunted by a tumultuous childhood tainted by mental illness, sexual and physical abuse, emotional neglect and profound trauma and a rebellious adolescence riddled with addiction and the loss of his father to cancer, Lewis’s path seemed set for perpetual darkness and self-sabotage. He served multiple prison sentences for offences including grievous bodily harm and was clinically diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, emotionally unstable personality disorder and bipolar type 2 while imprisoned. </p>
<p>But during his third stint in prison aged  24, Lewis decided he wasn’t going to continue to follow this dark path and pledged to make a change. From these depths, he created The Coaching Masters, a $25 million (£20m) academy and global community spanning 85 countries that some, including previous members, have described as ‘a cult’. This empire didn’t just bring financial success; it ushered Lewis into an elite circle of influence. </p>
<p><i>The Psychopath Life Coach</i> peels back the mask on psychopathy and allows viewers to form their opinion: Has Lewis genuinely evolved, casting aside his psychopathic traits? Or, with his intricate understanding of the human mind, has he masterfully crafted a narrative, seducing the world using his charisma for his own gain? </p>
<p>Watch the trailer for yourself below:</p>
<h3>When will <i>The Psychopath Life Coach</i> be released? </h3>
<p>The documentary lands on Netflix on 22 November, and will nudge viewers to reflect not merely on Lewis’s life tapestry, but to confront the uncomfortable truths about society, their loved ones and perhaps even themselves. </p>
<p>Be prepared to question everything you thought you knew about the life coaching industry, or even humanity, in this spine-tingling exploration of manipulation, narcissism and the pursuit of power.</p>
<p>Fascinating, indeed. </p></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nothing compares to the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/dating-love/real-first-date-stories-icks-instant-sparks-red-flags/803946" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">early, heady days of a relationship</a> – the flirty texts, the giddy butterflies, the late-night chats. But as wonderful as the first few months can be, they can also be stressful. In fact, there are several ways a promising relationship can go <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/signs-of-relationship-doom/701964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrong early on</a>.</p>
<p>In 2024, one of the most common killers of a young relationship is set to be PMI, also known as premature intimacy. Like TMI (the abbreviation for ‘too much information’), PMI involves sharing too much too fast. According to dating website Plenty of Fish, which <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/a-funny-bone-to-pick/202311/a-close-up-look-at-6-dating-trends-for-2024?amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surveyed</a> 6,000 daters in the US, PMI has become one of the most common dating woes. </p>
<p>We spoke to Jessica Alderson, co-founder and relationship expert at <a href="https://www.sosyncd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">So Synced</a>, to find out why PMI has become so frequent and what we should be doing about it.
	  </p>
<h2>What is PMI?</h2>
<p>PMI stands for premature intimacy.</p>
<p>“It refers to the act of engaging in <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mindfulness-intimacy-meditation-wellbeing/696298" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intimate</a> behaviour too soon in a new relationship,” says Alderson. </p>
<p>While this is often oversharing personal information, it can also refer to physical intimacy.</p>
<p>As Alderson explains, it can include everything from “prematurely holding hands or making a move” to “sharing deeply personal information or talking about future plans before the connection has had time to develop”.</p>

<h2>Why are so many people fast-tracking intimacy?</h2>
<p>According to the Plenty of Fish survey, people are increasingly engaging in intimate behaviour prematurely. So why is it happening?</p>
<p>“Some people have a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/rejection-emotions-management/656261" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fear of rejection</a> or abandonment and believe that by opening up quickly they can create a strong bond,” she says. “They may believe that by being vulnerable and sharing personal information in the early stages of dating, their date will see them as more desirable or trustworthy.”</p>
<p>Another reason might be that some people simply find that intimacy comes naturally to them.</p>
<p>“They may not realise that their level of disclosure is more than what is typical in the early stages of a relationship,” she says. “We all have different levels of openness and vulnerability, and some people are just more naturally inclined to share personal details.”</p>

</div>
</section>
<p>Some people may not even realise that they’re going too fast too soon.</p>
<p>According to Alderson: “Not everyone reads social cues effectively. This means that they might misinterpret the level of intimacy in the relationship or assume that their date is on the same level as them.”</p>
<p>Finally, PMI can come from a need for validation.</p>
<p>“When someone shares deeply personal information, they may be hoping to receive reassurance from their date,” she says. “This stems from a place of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/insecurity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">insecurity</a> and a need for external validation.”</p>

</figure>
<h2>PMI has consequences</h2>
<p>Although PMI may seem like a fairly harmless habit in relationships, it does have its consequences.</p>
<p><b>Overwhelming your date: “</b>It might create a sense of pressure or discomfort, especially if the recipient isn’t ready for such depth of information,” she says.</p>
<p><b>Loss of intrigue:</b> Share too much too soon and the relationship will lose its intrigue. According to Alderson: “A gradual unfolding of personal details can contribute to the anticipation and enjoyment of discovering more about each other over time.”</p>
<p><b>Misalignment of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/emotional-consent-early-stages-of-dating/528740" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emotional intimacy</a>: </b>“This difference may lead to one person feeling more invested or emotionally connected than the other, which can cause issues in the relationship,” she says.</p>
<p><b>Potential for misinterpretation: </b>In some cases, PMI can lead to misunderstandings and discomfort. “Without a solid foundation of trust and understanding, your date may not have the context to interpret the information accurately,” says Alderson.</p>
<p><b>Limited room for growth:</b> Relationships should be allowed to develop naturally over time. Says Alderson: “Oversharing early on can leave little room for growth and discovery as a couple. This can hinder the development of a strong, lasting bond.”</p>
<h2>Want a healthy dating life? Avoid PMI </h2>
<p>With PMI set to become one of the biggest dating trends of 2024, now is the time to make sure you don’t get into the habit – and that you know how to deal with it if it happens to you.</p>
<p>“Self-awareness is key to avoiding PMI and understanding your tendencies to overshare,” warns Alderson. “Before you share something personal, ask yourself if it’s appropriate for the stage of your relationship and if you’re sharing for the right reasons.”</p>
<p>Also, look for signs your new partner is comfortable. “If you notice them becoming uncomfortable or disinterested in what you’re sharing, it’s a sign to slow down with the personal details,” she says.</p>

</section>
<p>“If someone is oversharing or being prematurely intimate with you, it’s important to communicate your discomfort or lack of readiness for that level of intimacy,” she adds. “Be honest and direct but also understanding and empathetic. When done in the right way, it won’t damage your connection and might instead create a stronger bond based on open communication and respect for each other’s boundaries.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tuesday 7 November was a day of firsts, for me and the country. Charles III delivered his first King’s Speech as monarch. It was also <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/rishi-sunak" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rishi Sunak</a>’s first as prime minister, offering him a chance to set out key policies after a year in the role. And, on a personal note, it was my first as chief executive of Mind, a charity dedicated to making sure that everyone experiencing a mental health problem gets support and respect.</p>
<p>Mental health problems affect around one in four people in any given year. The King’s Speech was an opportunity for the UK government to fulfil some promises to this large and growing group of people. But inexplicably, mental health didn’t appear on the prime minister’s list of priorities. </p>
<p>This was all the more difficult to stomach given the fact we know from NHS data that an increasing number of us are now experiencing severe mental health problems. This is partly because of long waiting lists and a lack of community care, as well as a result of the ongoing fallout from the pandemic and the cost of living crisis. More of us are reaching crisis point – this can mean lots of different things, including symptoms of psychosis, self-harm and struggling to keep yourself or others safe. This was a rarer experience once upon a time, but now, many of us reach this point and are ‘sectioned’ for treatment under the Mental Health Act – a hugely outdated piece of legislation.</p>
<section class="pp-article__boxout">
<div id="boxout_1" class="pp-boxout" style="background-color:#606060;">
<div class="pp-boxout__body">
<h4>It’s been tumbleweed from the government</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>In fact, more than <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/news-campaigns/news/uk-government-shelves-the-mental-health-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">50,000 people were detained</a> under this law in the last year alone – roughly the same number of people who live in towns like Salisbury or Dunfermline. And while people are supposedly detained under the Act for their own safety, most of the time the experience is traumatic and places of care, where they go to get better, are unsafe. The string of media exposés we’ve seen in recent months has further underlined the shocking reality of mental healthcare in this country in 2023.</p>
<p>Most of us assume that the mental health system is fair and that mental health hospitals are places where people receive compassionate care. Sadly, at Mind we see evidence every day that this isn’t always the case. We see figures that show how deep racial injustice runs through the system, with Black people nearly five times more likely to be sectioned than white people. We work with people who have spent time in mental health hospitals, describing them as cold, frightening and prison-like places where people are forcibly restrained, placed into seclusion for days on end, overmedicated and often abused. </p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Portrait of a sad young woman in her apartment, with a sun on her face," src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2022/07/18153254/gettyimages-905454252-1080x1080.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s for all these reasons that Mind, along with thousands of people with mental health problems, their friends, families, other organisations and medical experts have spent decades campaigning for the government to overhaul mental health legislation. Nothing has been done since 1983 to update laws that have a huge impact on people’s lives. The world was an incredibly different place then, and I remember how much less understanding there was of mental health and the things that cause people to struggle with it. What’s more, reforming the Mental Health Act was a key Conservative party commitment at two general elections, and has also been widely supported by politicians from all main parties. </p>
<p>So, if these changes are not only politically popular but also evidence-based, why were they shelved? It’s a mystery I certainly can’t answer, and it’s been tumbleweed from the government on this front since last week. But we are seeing some green shoots of hope; the Labour party has just committed to prioritising getting reforms to the Mental Health Act through if they get into power at the next general election.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s important to recognise that good care does exist and that NHS staff are trying their absolute best against a backdrop of limited funding that continues to fall short of surging demand. And to applaud the countless people who have never lost hope and dedicated huge amounts of time, effort and resources to improving care, despite the lack of action from the government. The hard work is already done; we now need politicians with enough backbone to make the changes a reality.</p>
<p>This government’s failure to reform this legislation has been a painful blow for the mental health community, and we know people are anxious about what this means for them and their loved ones. At Mind, to say we’re gutted doesn’t begin to cover it, and we won’t stop fighting until everyone with a mental health problem gets the support and respect they deserve. Our call now is for whoever is in power following the next general election to have mental health at the top of their priority list. We expect to hear commitments from all parties that they will do this.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Christmas season fast approaching, a lot of people will be gearing up for an ice skating whizz around the rink. Yet the question remains: ‘How do I skate?’ As a former professional ice skater, I know a thing or two about staying upright on ice, so I’ve pulled together my top tips for gliding rather than falling at speed.</p>
<p>It’s worth pointing out that ice skating is a sport that uses a great deal of core strength, so for those of you big on pilates and yoga, you’ll already have an advantage. In terms of technique, minimal adjustments can have maximum effects, so be subtle – save those big, swooping movements for your next dance class (on dry land).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main thing with most sports is to believe you can do it; if you think you will fall then you will, as believing you can skate will help you to move with ease. And with learning to ice skate, it’s important to acknowledge that you will fall, and although it might hurt from time-to-time, falling isn’t something to be scared of.
	  </p>
<p>Here’s how to get started with learning to ice skate as an adult.</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Women doing up ice skates" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/10/14114738/gettyimages-1665885052-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><\h2><h3>1. Go for clothes that have give in them</h3>
<p>Avoid hard jeans, long skirts or floaty material. Instead, dress in layers that are tight to your body. As with most workouts, you need to use your leg muscles without feeling constricted.  </p>
<h3>2. Prioritise avoiding blisters</h3>
<p>Make sure you have either two pairs of socks that go up past the top of the boot or wear socks over tights. Boots aren’t always comfortable and wearing socks that have indented patterns can rub you up the wrong way.</p>
<h3>3. Wear gloves</h3>
<p>You want to avoid leather ones and go for pairs that help you to grip the barrier and/or will protect your hands if you fall. But any gloves are better than none!&nbsp;</p>
<h2><\h2><h3>4. Go when the ice is fresh</h3>
<p>Try to join a session straight after the Zamboni has cleaned the ice and it’s gleaming. The more the ice looks like snow, the less you will be able to glide on it. </p>
<h3>5. Ask for the sharpest pair of blades</h3>
<p>Blades are meant to be sharp to grip the ice and have two edges inside and outside. The sharper the blade, the easier skating will be. No one can skate with blunt blades. </p>
<h3>6. Lace your boots tightly</h3>
<p>You want them to be as tight as possible, with no loose laces hanging down. It should be difficult to bend while wearing your skates because they’re your support.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7. Do a quick warm up</h3>
<p>Jump around a little and stretch out your hamstrings in your boots. Get a feeling of standing and being in the boots on safe ground. Try bending your knees in them and get to understand what that feels like off the ice; it’ll make actually being on the ice much less scary!</p>
<h2><\h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Wish you could skate? Never got close to leaving the sides of the rink? Now's the time to learn." src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/10/18140716/skating-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>8. Hold on to the barrier as you get onto the ice</h3>
<p>Move along a little and practise the feeling of bending your knees and moving your feet back and forth. Don’t be scared by the glide feeling; it <i>is</i> different to walking.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>9. Bend your knees but keep your head up</h3>
<p>&nbsp;You want your knees to bend, and your ankle and hips to be in line with your head. Do not lean forwards; skating is all about bending without leaning. If you feel like you’re sticking your bum out, however, you’ve bent too far. Get this starting position right and trust me, everything else will fall into place.</p>
<h3>10. Make small movements, not sudden ones</h3>
<p>Most people fall because they lean forward too much, think they are going to fall and then immediately, in a big motion, pull themselves backwards and end up face-palming the ice.</p>
<h3>11. Use your weight to help you get round the rink</h3>
<p>Your weight should be just below the toe pick where the blade has a slight curve at the front end of the skate. The ideal is that you push off by bending your left leg, while your right leg pushes you forward at a diagonal angle from behind. The weight is shifted from the left to the right; it is not meant to be evenly distributed as one leg will always have more weight on it.</p>
<p>As you get to the curve of the rink more established skaters will do crossovers, but you should try to always lean into the circle and not against it. Go with the flow. A lot of skating happens on edges and curves, so always lean slightly more to the side you are skating around. If the left leg is the inside leg this will bear the most weight.</p>
<h3>12. Don’t be afraid to stop&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The most usual way of coming to a halt is by joining your toes together and push your heels out (usually this is done on the dominant side). Again, bend into it and push out on the chosen foot while keeping your weight on the opposite side.</p>
<h3>13. Be aware of your surrounding</h3>
<p>Stay mindful of who is in front of you, behind you, to the side etc. If you want to turn to go around someone, lean into the direction you want to go in, but again, bend into the knees and keep your head up. This is not about leaning forward but leaning almost to the side you want to move to; if it’s the left, the weight will be more on the left leg.</p>
<h3>14. Learn to get back up&nbsp;</h3>
<p>If you fall over, it’s important to learn how to get up on your own. Allowing someone to help you get back up often results in both of you falling, unless that person is a skater. Turn on to your front on your knees, place one foot up and use your hands for balance, then bring the other foot up – keeping your knees bent as you get up. Avoid standing up too quickly and being too straight as you won’t feel secure. Again, keep your arms out for balance.&nbsp;</p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><\h2><p>If ice skating is something you start to enjoy and want to continue,  it’s exceptional for fitness and strengthening your body. You’ll soon find that your core strength is off the chart!&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are ice rinks open all year round across the UK, with great classes and teachers on site to help you progress.  Second hand skates can be bought cheaply and once you get your own pair, you’ll notice how much easier skating is when you’ve got a sharp blade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love to skate – 20 years after I officially gave up. There’s nothing like the wonderful feeling of gliding along at speed with the wind in your hair.&nbsp;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether on volcano-lined shores or across the gilded floor of a hotel lobby, there is nothing we love more than watching the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/inside-luxury-hospitality-the-white-lotus/746207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rich and privileged</a> swan around and, ultimately, get their comeuppance. And <i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/the-white-lotus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The White Lotus</a></i> has always given us both, in bucket-loads. </p>
<p>The fan-favourite <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/hbo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HBO</a> series won 10 Emmy awards for its first season and scooped two SAG awards and two Golden Globes last year for season two, where <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/jennifer-coolidge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Coolidge’s performance</a> as the overbearing yet endearing Tanya McQuoid was once again recognised with multiple best supporting actress wins. </p>
<p>So, naturally, all eyes are firmly fixed on the highly anticipated third season, for which details remain scarce, even though HBO officially renewed <i>The White Lotus </i>for season three back in November 2022.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/white-lotus-season-3-location-thailand-1235565604/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by <i>Variety</i></a><i></i>, we do now know where the no-doubt incredulous antics of season three will take place. Plus, in a new interview with <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, creator Mike White says that the third season will be “supersized”. </p>
<p>“It’s going to be longer, bigger, crazier. I don’t know what people will think, but I am super excited, so at least for my own barometer, that’s a good thing… I’m super excited about the content of the season.” He also went on to say that he’s finished many of the scripts and is eager to get going on production.</p>
<p>And now we have the latest update: now that the Sag-Aftra strike has come to an end, casting for the new season is officially underway. According to <i><a href="https://deadline.com/2023/11/the-white-lotus-season-3-start-of-production-date-casting-characters-1235604297/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>,</i> HBO is looking to fill 13 roles (including nine series regulars) ranging in age between 18-80. Among the guests at the White Lotus next season, we can expect to see a patriarch, a corporate executive, an actor, a couple of mothers, a misfit and a yogi.</p>
<p>Filming is set to commence in February 2024.</p>
<h2><b>Where is season 3 of <i>The White Lotus</i> set?</b></h2>
<p>As multiple sources close to the production have reportedly told <i>Variety</i>, <i>The White Lotus</i> is heading to Thailand.</p>
<p>While the first two seasons were shot at Four Seasons resorts in Hawaii and Italy, it’s possible that season three will take place at one of the luxury hotel giant’s four properties in Thailand, located in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Koh Samui and the Golden Triangle. </p>
<p>White previously hinted to <i>Variety</i> that season three could take place in Asia and focus on “death and Eastern religion and spirituality”.</p>
<p>“The first season kind of highlighted money, and then the second season is <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/sex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sex</a>,” White said in a clip pegged at the end of the explosive season two finale. “I think the third season would be maybe a satirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality. It feels like it could be a rich tapestry to do another round at <i>White Lotus</i>.”</p>
<p>Food for thought, indeed.</p>

<h2><b>Who will star in season 3 of <i>The White Lotus</i>?</b></h2>
<p>Before we all get too excited, we must remember that production on season three has yet to begin. As both seasons one and two featured a primarily new ensemble, it’s safe to assume there will be plenty of fresh faces on vacation in Asia when the time comes. However, if the rumour mill is to be believed (we’ll let you decide) anyone from Danny DeVito to Jamie Lee Curtis could be checking in. We <i>do</i> know that casting is underway, so hopefully, we’ll be meeting the new cast soon.</p>
<p>According to industry mag <i>Variety, </i>Natasha Rothwell is set to return to the series as spa manager Belinda for season three. She first appeared in the debut season of <i>The White Lotus</i>, when her character seemed to strike up a rapport with Coolidge’s character, Tanya. The wealthy heiress led her to believe that they might go into business together but was ultimately revealed to be stringing Belinda along.</p>
<p>The news of Rothwell’s return has got us speculating: will Belinda still be working at a White Lotus outpost? Or did Tanya actually leave her some money in her will? </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there’s one thing we can all agree we need more of in this increasingly fast-paced world,  it’s sleep. Where once we were able to drop off as soon as our heads hit the pillow, the full force of adulthood can make it tricky for our minds to stop overworking once we hit the hay – meaning sleep can be elusive.  </p>
<p>I’ve suffered my fair share of sleep-related woes. So, when I read about the US military-<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/sleep/how-to-sleep-fast-military-hack-two-minutes/224989" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">devised sleep method</a> designed to help time-poor soldiers <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/how-to-sleep-fast/485924" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fall asleep as fast</a> as possible, I needed to know more. Would it really be as easy as that to retrain my frazzled brain and body?</p>
<h2><\h2><p>Developed during the Second World War to help military personnel maximise their rest and improve performance, the method is reportedly used extensively by the US army, and it’s nothing short of an internet phenomenon. First documented in Lloyd Bud Winter’s 1981 book <i>Relax And Win: Championship Performance</i>, the premise is that with a few weeks of practice, you’ll be able to drop off in as little as 10 seconds or within a maximum of two minutes.  </p>
<p>According to The Sleep Charity, <a href="https://thesleepcharity.org.uk/information-support/adults/sleep-disorders/insomnia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one in three adults in the UK struggle with insomnia</a> and <a href="https://mentalhealth-uk.org/help-and-information/sleep/#:~:text=In%20reality%2C%20the%20latest%20research%20has%20shown%20that%3A,cite%20money%20worries%20as%20negatively%20impacting%20their%20sleep." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> shows that one in five of us aren’t getting enough shut-eye. And around 10-15% of us suffer from chronic sleep difficulties, so it’s easy to see why the idea of falling asleep within seconds has caught on. </p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Woman asleep with shadow over face" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/07155515/gettyimages-1492827105-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Put simply, the method works by harnessing breathing and relaxation techniques you’re probably already familiar with, like body scanning and visualisation.  </p>
<p>“The military sleep method uses a variation on progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing to help you enter a state of deep relaxation,” explains <a href="https://www.fantasticday.coach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hypnotherapist and coach Vic Paterson</a>.</p>
<p>“Both of these are really powerful techniques to aid relaxation and improve sleep. <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/sleep/breathing-exercises-techniques-rest-relaxation/771813" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Focusing on the breath</a> helps distract us from racing thoughts and worries and calm the nervous system, and working through the body to relax the muscles helps bring awareness from just the mind, where we are focusing on our worries, back to the body.” </p>
<h2><\h2><p>You won’t have to scroll too far on social media to find the steps to follow, but in case you missed them, this is how to do it.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Once you’re in a comfortable position in bed, start by relaxing your entire face, including all the muscles and your tongue, from your jaw to inside your mouth. If you find it difficult to isolate any of the muscles, try tensing them all first and then let go – you should be able to feel the release.  </li>
<li>Drop your shoulders to release any tension in your neck and upper back, and allow your hands to drop gently to the side of your body. </li>
<li>Exhale slowly, relaxing as you do so, and focus on your breath.  </li>
<li>As you breathe deeply, focus on relaxing your whole body, from your toes up your legs, calves and thighs, then on to your torso and finally your arms, hands and head. It can be helpful to think about gravity gently weighing you down – I focused on the sensation of my body relaxing into the mattress.  </li>
<li>Next, clear your mind by imagining a relaxing scene. If this is difficult, try repeating a relaxing mantra over and over.  </li>
<li>And sleep.  </li>
</ul>
<h2><\h2><p>Here’s the million-dollar question: does it really work? After six weeks of (sleep) training, I believe it does.  </p>
<p>Full disclosure: I tried this during a super hectic period of my life, when I was so tired at night that falling asleep itself wasn’t an issue. However, my main sleep-related gripe has always been waking up in the night (usually to take the dog out or because one of the kids has woken up) and being unable to get back to sleep for hours.</p>
<p>As I suspected, there were many nights in the six-week period when I was woken up in the (very) early hours. Usually, I’d lie and ruminate, thoughts swirling until eventually getting up to make a tea. During the experiment, however, these unwelcome nighttime wakings were a great opportunity to put the sleep method through its paces.  </p>
<section class="pp-article__boxout">
<div id="boxout_1" class="pp-boxout" style="background-color:#606060;">
<div class="pp-boxout__body">
<h4>Does it really work? After six weeks of, I believe it does</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>And I was surprised to discover that on some nights I only got as far as the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/wim-hof-breathing-stress/807466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deep breathing</a> exercise before falling asleep. Considering that I’ve had nights where it’s taken me hours to get back to sleep (usually falling into a deep, dreamless sleep around an hour before being woken by my alarm), spending as little as 10 or 15 minutes awake has been a revelation.  
	  </p>
<p>It’s important to note that while the method might seem like a quick fix, it does take time and patience to perfect. Experts recommend that you practise the technique nightly for six weeks before you can accurately put it to the test, so you do have to be fully committed to the process.  </p>
<p>Many of us get stressed about how long we spend lying awake, and it’s worth flagging that expecting to be asleep after two minutes might add extra pressure. If that sounds like it could be a risk, then it’s important to let go of any time pressure or expectations. </p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Woman dozing on the sofa" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/07162207/gettyimages-1387048257-1-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s also worth remembering that while I found the techniques effective, no amount of deep breathing will negate poor sleep hygiene (eg too much late-night screen time, inconsistent sleep schedules and other poor sleep habits). If you’re still regularly struggling to sleep, you might find these need to be addressed or seek support from your GP.  </p>
<p>As for whether it’s worth a try, well, there really is nothing to lose. Even if your sleep remains the same, you’ll still be learning and practising techniques that will only benefit your mental and physical health. </p>
<p>I’ve learned that my breath is the key component, and I’ve started to focus more on breathing correctly throughout the day (particularly when I’m feeling highly stressed) and have felt calmer and more balanced as a result. Ultimately, if you’re creating a consistent sleep routine that centres on de-stressing, relaxing and clearing your mind (even if you’re still awake after two minutes), that’s time well spent.  </p></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“The tears usually begin two or three days before my period starts and continue into the first day of my period. Anything can set me off, from a stressful day at work, an innocent comment from my husband or something heartwarming or even romantic on the TV,” says Gemma, 34, a biology teacher from Billericay. </p>
<p>“I am so sensitive and take everything to heart; things that wouldn’t usually bother me can set off a flood of tears. I also get a mix of extreme insomnia and horrible nightmares for four days before my period, which makes me even more sensitive. I feel sad, teary and just generally flat, like nothing is quite right in my life.”</p>
<h2><\h2><p>Gemma is not alone in experiencing emotional upset in the form of tears as part of her PMS (premenstrual syndrome) symptoms, and although the exact numbers of women who find themselves in tears <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16734317/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and the reasons why they do</a> needs more research, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-menstrual-syndrome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the NHS states that most women will have PMS at some point</a>, with mood swings and feeling upset at the top of their list of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/period-flu-symptoms-compared-to-coronavirus/437993" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms</a>.</p>
<p>“Feeling tearful is common and normal. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3634788/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Almost 75% of women</a> feel these cyclical emotional changes,” says <a href="https://www.doctorrebeccamoore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Rebecca Moore</a>, a consultant psychiatrist whose patients include women suffering with <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/media-a/2947/pmdd-2017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)</a> and those going through the menopause. “It’s not fully understood why women get premenstrual changes but it’s likely because of changes in their hormone levels during the menstrual cycle,” she explains. </p>
<h2><\h2><p>“Around ovulation, the body releases an egg, causing oestrogen and progesterone levels to drop. This shift can cause both physical and emotional symptoms and influence serotonin levels – a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood, sleep and appetite. Low levels of serotonin are linked to feeling tearful and sad as well as feelings of irritability, sleep issues and food cravings – which are all common PMS symptoms.”</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="not-crying" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/05/27171747/not-crying-crop-1590596341-1386x1386.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And pre-period hormonal changes could also affect connectivity between two brain networks: the default mode network and the salience network. “These networks play key roles in creating our emotional life, and studies have shown that they can be impacted by the changes in oestrogen and progesterone levels,” explains Dr Moore.</p>
<p>“Other studies indicate that female test subjects who receive ovarian hormones designed to mimic the menstrual cycle report an increase in negative mood and show an enhanced stress response.”
	  </p>
<p>Beth, 33, from Sheffield is all too familiar with the emotional rollercoaster that can come before a period. “The tears can kick in about eight days before my period is due,” she says. </p>
<p>“I’m always more likely to feel teary in the morning – like the day ahead is going to be too much for me. It’s not every day, it can come and go, and lasts a couple of days into a new cycle.” </p>
<p>The illustrator explains what triggers the tears. “I find it’s usually ‘real life’ stuff: work, chores, family, to-do lists. I have two young children and often get a bad night’s sleep, but in the few days before my period is due, I find it harder to cope with the lack of sleep – that’s probably my biggest trigger for tears. I feel stressed and desperate, and I always feel sorry for myself.”</p>
<h2><\h2><h3>Think about period-friendly supplements</h3>
<p>The mini pill worked for Gemma for a while. “I was on it for years, and the main reason was to help stabilise my tearfulness,” she says. “I had to come off due to other side effects or I would still be on it.” Gemma has recently turned to supplements instead. “I have been taking a high dose of magnesium and it has made so much difference, I didn’t cry last month – the first time in ages. It also helps with cramps and with the insomnia too.”</p>
<h3>Do things that make you feel good</h3>
<p>So what else can be done to keep the tears at bay? “Build a toolkit to lift your mood. This can include seeing friends, sleep, watching a comforting film – things that make you feel good,” explains Dr Moore, who is also co-founder of the Birth Better collective, which helps mothers-to-be with information and resources. </p>
<p>“Track your cycles and learn to understand your patterns and how they affect you, read <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/podcasts/how-does-period-affect-sex-drive-maisie-hill-period-power-podcast/481032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Period Power</i> by Maisie Hill</a> and think about <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/how-to-cope-without-access-to-therapy/514000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">therapy</a> to help you learn new ways of thinking, and to manage your thoughts and cognition.”</p>

</figure>
<h3>Track your period</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);">Tracking her period is something that Beth has started to do. “Some of the people I followed on Instagram were talking about period journaling/tracking apps, so I downloaded the Clue app to track mood, energy, sleep and pain throughout my cycle,” she explained. “It obviously doesn’t take the symptoms away, but knowing there’s a pattern and a hormonal reason helps. I know it’ll be over in a few days, and it encourages me that I can, and will, manage it, because I do so every month.”</span></p>
<h3>Prioritise nourishing food and exercise</h3>
<p>And <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31518647/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies have shown</a> that diet and exercise can also play a part. “Limit salt, caffeine and alcohol; drink plenty of water; eat green leafy veg, complex carbs such as sweet potatoes, lentils or unprocessed oats and nuts; and iron rich foods such as lean meat,” says Dr Moore. “And exercise increases endorphins, which are natural mood lifters and can help sleep regulate too. Training also helps distract us from some of those PMS feelings.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/stylist-network-event-how-to-return-to-work/799122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Returning to work</a> after a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/best-ways-to-return-after-break/803580" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">career break</a> can be incredibly daunting. There’s a misconception that this time out of the workforce will impact the quality of your professional skills and that you might be less ‘employable’ in the eyes of a recruiter.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.beapplied.com/post/career-gap#:~:text=The%20study%20found%20that%20women,of%20this%20data%20below..." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research</a> has found that women are more likely to have a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/when-to-return-to-work/801490" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gap in their CV</a>, defined as six months or more, and almost 40% of women cited childcare as the main reason for this break, compared to 11% of men. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/women-finding-job-after-career-break-tough-indepenn/#:~:text=Bringing%20women%20back%20to%20work&text=According%20to%20a%20LinkedIn%20survey,boost%20their%20confidence%20at%20work." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">majority (78%) of working women</a> who have taken a career break – whether for mental or physical health, childcare, following a redundancy, travel, or return to higher education – said that this break improved their wellbeing.  However, 70% of women felt less confident about applying for new jobs or asking for a pay rise when they wanted to return to work. </p>
<p>Navigating this process back into the workforce on your own can be difficult, but a new movement is emerging to help bridge the gap for professionals coming back into the workplace after a break, known as ‘returnships’. </p>
<p>The concept has been around since 2008 in the US when Goldman Sachs coined the term and introduced the innovative new scheme, initially offering three to six-month placements with the potential for full-time employment afterwards. It gained traction with a host of renowned corporate companies before it hopped across the pond to the UK.  </p>
<p>Julianne Miles, CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://womenreturners.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Women Returners</a>, has spent almost a decade educating employers on this game-changing strategy and has advised over 10,000 women taking on this transition. </p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="returnships" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/07121341/gettyimages-1345111851-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A returnship is a paid three to six-month placement for professionals to join a company and develop their skills through training or mentoring. Afterwards, Miles found that 80-90% of the candidates will be offered a permanent role at the company. </p>
<p>“A returnship enables you to resume your career, pick up where you left off or use your transferable skills in a different role or sector,” Miles tells <i>Stylist</i>. “You have the opportunity to refresh your skills and experience, with a softer landing and a framework of support – the early months can be an emotional rollercoaster. </p>
<p>“The initial placement period gives you a trial period to check that the role and organisation are a good fit for you.”</p>
<p>Another benefit of this scheme is that returnships are normally run for a small group of professionals at one time, creating a support group for returners who are in the same position after a career break. </p>
<p>One of the main prejudices that professionals face after time out of work is the assumption that they have lost their previous skills and their industry knowledge is out of date, compared to someone who has more recent experience. This career break penalty typically makes it harder for candidates to be hired in a traditional application for a new job. </p>
<p>Miles explains: “The career break penalty is a result of these barriers faced by people who have taken a long break, meaning that returners too often return to lower-level, lower-paid jobs, feel they have to retrain or don’t get back into the workforce at all.”</p>
<p>“A returnship aims to bring returners back into suitable-level roles, ringfenced for returners (they are being targeted for their career break, rather than rejected because of it).</p>
<p>“Training is given to recruiters and interviewers and assessments are adapted to value work and life skills rather than recent technical knowledge. The support provided helps them to quickly rebuild their professional confidence and quickly get back up to speed.” </p>

<h4>We want to tackle the cultural stigma of career breaks</h4>

</section>
<p>Since 2014, Miles has supported 3,000 women land returner opportunities across 170 employers, who had career breaks spanning from 18 months to 30 years. From helping individuals battle the psychological impact of their “loss of a professional identity” to tackling recruitment bias against candidates without recent experience, it has been important for Women Returners to address <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/career-gap-explained/758422" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the cultural stigma of career breaks</a>. </p>
<p>“We help to tackle the recruitment barriers by partnering with over 170 leading employers on returnships and other returner programmes and jobs,” Miles continued. “We work with them to break down the bias, making them more inclusive of returners, valuing the maturity, fresh perspective and wealth of life and work skills that they bring.”</p>
<p>A career break can also be an opportunity to change industries when you return to work, as you reflect on what you want and need from your career to make it more fulfilling for you and enticing to return. </p>
<p>If you’re looking to find a new job after a career break, Women Returners has a host of <a href="https://womenreturners.com/returners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free advice on its website</a>, a <a href="https://womenreturners.com/returners/career-returners-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast</a> and has even written a handy step-by-step <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/returner-toolkit-helping-you-back-to-work/returner-toolkit-helping-you-back-to-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">return to work toolkit</a> for the UK government.&nbsp;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s 4pm in the <i>Stylist</i> office and, as I type this, the person beside me is battling a fit of sneezes. Across the bank of desks, a colleague is grabbing another tissue in a bid to quiet their sniffles. I’ve become so accustomed to the sound of hushed coughing over the past few days that I almost don’t notice it – until someone breaks out in a fit of splutters. At this point, getting through the next few weeks without <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/long-cold-symptoms-risk/835464" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">catching something</a> feels almost impossible.  </p>
</p>
<p>In an effort to improve my chances of dodging the outbreak, I went looking for preventative measures to arm myself with. I discovered that there’s far more to the current breakout than meets the eye: welcome to Peak Lurgy Week and the surprising science driving the rise in snotty noses.   </p>
</p>
<p>The last couple of weeks have laid the groundwork for a sickness spike, with the snap transition from summer to autumn kicking things off. In London, where I live, things have been all over the place: from the balmy 26°C temperatures at the start of last month to this week’s 10°C, the difference in weather conditions couldn’t have been more stark.  </p></p>
<section class="pp-article__boxout">
<div id="boxout_1" class="pp-boxout" style="background-color:#606060;">
<div class="pp-boxout__body">
<h4> A sudden shift in weather makes things worse</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>We already know that a drop in temperature can make us more susceptible to illness (<a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(22)01423-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a study</a> by US scientists published at the end of last year found cooler temperatures can affect our nasal immune response), but such a sudden shift makes things worse. The time when we’d usually be digging out winter coats, wearing in a new pair of boots and gradually spending more time inside was spent sunbathing in the park and drinking with friends, so when the weather did eventually dip (dropping 20°C in one week), it was a shock to the system. Now, we’re all struggling to keep up.   </p>
</p>
<p>“Germs are around all year, but during the autumn and winter months – when the temperature starts to drop – people tend to be <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/cold-weather-impact-viruses-immune-system/721458" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more susceptible</a> to cold, flu and other viruses,” explains Dr Jayne Patricia Ballinger de Quispe, lead physician at <a href="https://www.bupa.co.uk/health/payg/gp-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bupa Health Clinics</a>. This is, of course, the driving force behind every cold and flu season (as well as the increased proportion of time we spend inside with other people, where illnesses spread more easily). But going from spending all day outdoors in the hot sun to being wrapped up inside while the rain pours – all within the course of a few weeks – has likely made the shift from summer to cold and flu season feel a lot more drastic than we’re used to.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="There's a myriad of reasons causing the current outbreak of cold" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/13163047/cover_extra_illness_insta_144ppi_v6-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The autumnal, grey weather we’ve been experiencing will also affect our vitamin D levels, which can have a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/can-supplements-really-help-to-boost-your-immune-system/369908" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">knock-on effect</a> on our immune system. While vitamin D’s primary role lies in the maintenance of bone health, it can also affect our ability to fight off viral and bacterial infections; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166406/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research has shown</a> it does this in several ways, including aiding the production of cytokines, which regulate inflammation across the body and help to modulate the immune response, and antimicrobial proteins, which play a critical role in warding off invasive pathogens.   </p>
</p>
<p>This is all well and good during summer because one of the main ways we take in vitamin D is through the sun shining on our skin. However, when the weather turns grey and the UV index dips (below three is when vitamin D production is limited, and it’s been sitting around one for the last couple of weeks), it becomes harder and harder for us to produce enough to keep up with what our body needs.  </p>
</p>
<p>This is why <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the NHS recommends</a> everyone should take a vitamin D supplement from early October to the end of March – but many of us fail to do so. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-0558-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study published in 2020</a> found that around 40% of Europeans are vitamin D deficient, with 13% being severely deficient. These levels might have shifted a little due to the emphasis placed on vitamin D supplements during the pandemic, but chances are there are still many of us lacking in this all-important nutrient (and potentially struggling to fight off colds and flu as a result).  </p>
<p>Indeed, while you <i>can</i> get some vitamin D from your diet, many of the main sources of the vitamin – such as oily fish, eggs and fortified dairy products – are animal-based, meaning those on plant-based diets may be at greater risk of deficiency. The same is true for people from Black, Asian and mixed-race backgrounds, adds <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/vitamin-d-deficiency-symptoms-signs-immune-system-fatigue/403575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toral Shah</a>, a nutritional scientist and functional medicine practitioner. “Melanin makes it harder for you to make vitamin D,” she says. “The recommended levels are also set according to the needs of white people, so there aren’t enough studies to show much vitamin D people of colour need.”   </p>
</p>
<p>The clocks going back at the end of last month could also be taking a toll on our ability to stay well. Not only is the hour’s shift enough to mess with our body clock, but the dark evenings and reduced daylight hours can also lead to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/sleep/circadian-rhythm-disruption-signs-causes/821727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circadian rhythm</a> disruption, a condition where our body’s internal time is out of sync with the environment. “If your circadian rhythm is off, your body may not function at its best,” explains Theresa Schnorbach, Emma’s sleep scientist. “The quality of your sleep may also be reduced, meaning you wake in the night and have shallower sleep overall.”  </p>
</p>
<p>These consequences of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/what-is-circadian-rhythm/813087" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circadian rhythm</a> disruption can affect our immunity in several ways – including when it comes to how well our immune system functions. You see, while our circadian rhythm is best known for impacting the sleep/wake cycle, it also plays a vital role in regulating our immune system. This is why disruptions to our body clock – whether driven by jet lag, shift work or the clocks changing – can put us at greater risk of falling ill. </p>
</p>
<p>Reductions in sleep quality and duration are also bad news for our immune system. “During sleep, your body secretes hormones involved in fighting disease,” <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/immune-system-signs-its-low-how-to-boost/429230" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explains Dr Sarah Brewer</a>, a GP and author. “People who sleep for seven to eight hours have better immunity than those who are sleep deprived.” This link has been proven time and time again, with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2629403/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a famous study published in 2009</a> showing that those who chronically get less than seven hours of sleep a night are three times as likely to develop a common cold than those who routinely get more.  </p>
<p>With this in mind, it’s hardly surprising that so many of us are feeling rubbish at the moment. Our bodies are dealing with a lot right now – and that’s not considering the added mental pressure many of us are feeling as <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/seasonal-affective-disorder-how-to-cope-sad-winter-depression-prevention-tips/314582" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seasonal affective disorder</a> sets in. The reluctance to take sick days while working from home is also making it harder for us to recover; <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.748053/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous research</a> found that remote working leads to an increase in ‘presenteeism’ – when people work more hours than required, for example, when they should be taking sick leave. </p>
</p>
<p>But here’s the thing – if we want to get better, now’s the time to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/cold-flu-how-to-feel-better/585392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prioritise rest</a>, including taking sick days (and that means real sick days, not ‘I’ll just be working from home’ days) when they’re needed. If the pandemic taught us anything, it’s that the importance of protecting our health should never be underestimated. If staying in bed all day and watching <i>Gilmore Girls</i> is what your body needs right now, then that’s exactly what you should do. Doctor’s orders.</p>
<h2><\h2><h2><\h2><p>If your hand washing routine has become a little lacklustre post-pandemic, now’s the time to get reacquainted. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water on a regular basis and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean. Popping an extra bottle of hand sanitiser into your bag is probably a good idea, too.

<h2><\h2><p>Natural supplements can work wonders for a cold – especially when it comes to reducing your chances of getting one in the first place. Echinacea, also called the purple coneflower, is a popular option for supporting immunity, and can be bought in both liquid and tablet form at most health shops. “Echinacea has a natural, antimicrobial action, increases the number and activity of white blood cells involved in fighting infections and has an anti-inflammatory action to reduce symptoms if an infection takes hold,” <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/immune-system-signs-its-low-how-to-boost/429230" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Brewer explains</a>.    </p>
<p>While some experts debate the efficacy of echinacea, there has been some fascinating research into its ability to help us stay well. Indeed, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7106401/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a review of 14 clinical trials</a> found that echinacea can reduce the odds of developing a cold by 58% and the duration of a cold by one to four days.  </p>
<h2><\h2><p><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/immune-system-gut-health-colds/737503" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Up to 80% of your immune system is in the gut</a>, so if you really want to stave off illness, showing your microbiome some TLC could be the answer. Taking simple steps such as upping your fibre intake, increasing the variety of plants you eat, staying hydrated and eating fermented foods (such as kimchi and kefir) is a great place to start. 
	  </p>
<h2><\h2><p>Investing in a medicine cabinet’s worth of supplements might seem like an easy way to keep yourself well during autumn and winter, but it’s probably not as beneficial as you think it is. In fact, many of the common ‘immune boosting’ supplements out there – such as vitamin C and zinc – won’t make much of a difference <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/can-supplements-really-help-to-boost-your-immune-system/369908" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unless you’re actually deficient</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, experts recommend adopting a ‘food first’ approach to nutrition, where supplements only do what their name suggests – supplement nutrients you can’t get from your diet (vitamin D is a prime example of this). </p>
</p>
<p>“Fill your plate with colourful vegetables, whole grains and some dairy, meat, fish or plant protein to help support your protective defences,” <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/cold-flu-season-immune-preparation/823375" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explains Claire Nevinson</a>, superintendent pharmacist for Boots. Good sources of zinc include dark chocolate, pumpkin seeds, dairy products and chickpeas, while good sources of vitamin C include citrus fruits, bell peppers, cruciferous vegetables and strawberries.  </p></p>
<h2><\h2><p>Exercise can work wonders for your immune system. <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/exercise-health-benefits-boost-immune-system-prevent-illness/367173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to research</a> from the Appalachian State University and the University of North Carolina, those who do five or more days of exercise a week have 43% fewer days with URTI (upper respiratory tract illness) symptoms than those who do one day or less. However, the type of exercise you’re doing matters.</p>
<p>While cardiovascular training is important (<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/exercise-guidelines/physical-activity-guidelines-for-adults-aged-19-to-64/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the NHS recommends</a> 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity a week), balancing higher-intensity sessions with lower-impact activities is vital for your immune health. “Exercise should be non-competitive, so avoid over-training and marathons,” <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/immune-system-signs-its-low-how-to-boost/429230" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Brewer explains</a>. “Physical stress suppresses immunity and increases the risk of developing symptoms when exposed to a common cold virus.”  </p></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Retinol: it’s one of the few skincare ingredients proven to deliver transformative results and is a firm favourite among dermatologists. Derived from <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/benefits-of-retinol-skincare-best-retinol-serum-eye-cream-moisturiser/193908" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vitamin A, retinols</a> improve cell turnover, help <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hyperpigmentation-treatment-how-to-get-rid-of-skin-pigmentation-melasma-dark-spots/306348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fade pigmentation</a>, encourage collagen production and reduce spots.</p>
<p>However, retinol can cause skin sensitivity and irritation. “We speak to a lot of people who have burnt their face with <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/best-retinol-retinoid-cream-serum-skin-acne/208329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retinol</a> because they didn’t really know what retinol was,” says Colette Newbury, co-founder of The Inkey List. If you’re a beginner, experts recommend building up your skin’s tolerance. Start with a low percentage two to three times a week, gradually working your way up to every night.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while it’s hailed as <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/simple-skincare-routine-vitamin-c-retinol-spf/231872" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a holy grail ingredient</a>, its associations with skin irritation means some people worry about applying it to more sensitive areas of the face, such as your eyes. But this area is actually one of the key places to apply retinol. “Fine lines will start to appear here, which is one of the benefits of retinol” explains Mary Curry, co-founder of The Inkey List. </p>
<p>As retinol <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/this-is-why-you-definitely-should-be-wearing-eye-cream/179439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">encourages collagen production</a>, it leaves skin plump and smooth. While you should be careful of getting retinol too close to your eyes, it’s fine to apply it around the contour of the eye. In fact, The Inkey List even made its own retinol eye cream.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a slow release retinol in there at 0.1% actual retinol,” says Curry. “This is because it’s working overtime overnight, so you’re going to get the impact.”</p>
<p>Eager to give it a go? Here’s some of our favourite retinol eye creams…</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How the style set stay cosy and cool at the same time is a topic of great concern among fashion lovers; how on earth does anyone keep warm while looking put-together?</p>
<p>The answer, according to the streets of the most recent <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/fashion-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fashion weeks</a>, comes in the form of a knee-skimming quilted coat, whose cuddly, wearable sleeping bag iterations are being offered by the It brands of the moment. <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/designer-collaborations/837859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ganni and Barbour have recently joined forces</a> to launch a wonderfully padded capsule of chic coats.</p>

<p>While their ostentatiously large older sister, the dutiful duvet <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/upgrade-casualwear-best-coats/825182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coat</a>, was the outerwear du jour last winter – keeping us cosy, comfortable and feeling like we never left our bed on cold winter mornings – their 2023 lightweight counterpart is what the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/11-best-high-street-fashion/749801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fashion </a>set are reaching for this year.</p>
<p>The beauty in this year’s trend is that their statement-making cocoon shapes act as something of a sartorial shell; merely the exterior of an otherwise swaddling layered winter ensemble.</p>
<p>To follow the fashion crowd, pair your longline quilted coat with straight-legged jeans and, of course, clad your feet in the all-important <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/best-statement-boots/696179" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement boots</a>, chunky loafers or even <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/ugg-mini-platform-boots/713957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uggs</a> (yes, they’re back and even fluffier).</p>
<p>The options are limitless, but the takeaway is clear: it’s time to take your quilted jacket to new lengths. These are a few of our favourite longline quilted jackets to invest in now to see you well on your way to wrapping up this winter. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/exercise-motivation-evolution/620282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exercise motivation</a> can wax and wane all year round, for many of us, fitness is way more <i>doable</i> when the weather is decent. You can wake up early to fit in a sunrise run; you’ve got hours after work for a mind-clearing walk or cycle; you’re not tempted to cancel a class because it’s teeming down with rain. During autumn and winter, however, it’s often cold, dark and wet. </p>
<p>It’s no wonder that a new piece of research has found that 80% of Brits worry that during the winter, the fitness and wellness activities that make us feel good are too expensive to access. Commissioned by <a href="https://kicapp.com/uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">health and wellness app Kic</a>, the 2,000-person-strong research found that 54% dislike going out on dark mornings and evenings, while 44% <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/women-running-dark-safety/723977" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">don’t feel safe running in the dark</a> – a percentage that’s no doubt higher among women.  </p>
<p>If you don’t feel safe running in the dark, then the obvious solution is to hop on a treadmill –but that comes at a sizable cost. <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/treadmill-walkingpad-walking-while-working-desk/765224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">At-home treadmills</a> start at about £200 (assuming you have the space), while the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/budget-low-cost-gym-benefits/598780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cheapest gym memberships</a> hang around the £15.99 a month mark. That might be manageable, but getting to that gym requires schlepping through the pouring rain or leaving your warm home to work out, and if your motivation is already low, you might end up chucking good money after bad.</p>
<p>And then we have the impact that shorter days can have on our mental health. The Kic study found that the cold makes 40% of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/winter-tiredness-fatigue-tips/465193" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people feel sluggish</a>, with reduced sunlight leaving 36% of us feeling like there’s less time in the day to exercise. If you’re already short on time, it’s one thing lacing up and heading out of your front door, and another to have to commute to exercise.</p>
<p>Now, we can’t solve all these issues but there are things you can do to make staying active a little easier. As someone who works out all year (it’s my job, after all), there are five tools I use for maintaining motivation – no matter how grim it gets outside. Best of all? They’re either free or reusable. </p>
<h2><\h2><h3>Try short, free at-home YouTube workouts</h3>
<p>The biggest barrier to motivation, in my experience, is not knowing where to start. If you have to think about which exercises to do, you’re more likely to just not do them. YouTube is brimming with free workouts that cater to all fitness tastes and experiences. All you have to decide is the length and type of exercise you want to do. </p>
<p>Need a pre-work energy boost? Give this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcxzO9FSLfQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10-minute sweaty endorphin ‘good mood’ dance workout</a> a go. If you have more time, then check out Kayla Itsine’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvGq8sWZKxs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30-minute bodyweight strength workout</a> – ideal for shaking off the day and getting strong from home. I have a gym membership, but I’ll often choose a YouTube workout over cycling for 30 minutes to lift weights.</p>
<h3>Get a Lumie lamp </h3>
<p>OK, this does involve an initial upfront cost (<a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/lumie-sunrise-alarm-wake-up-to-daylight-table-lamp-white/p4875803?s_ppc=2dx_mixed_home_BAU&tmad=c&tmcampid=2&gclid=Cj0KCQiAr8eqBhD3ARIsAIe-buOFHZ4ixJ1UNqT3bsORk7dajg1IymumLLB3VxG14XxZw3iya9REfOkaAiQ5EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starting at about £40</a>), but if you’re struggling to wake up early enough to actively commute or get a little movement in before work begins, then a SAD lamp could make a huge difference. I’ve been using a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/sad-lamp-review-lumie/594170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lumie</a> for about five years, and it’s made getting up at 5.30am on gym days a breeze. It emits light very gradually, so by the time your alarm goes off, you’re already wide awake – no snooze button necessary. Even if you want to exercise in the evening, it makes getting up during the winter months easier.  </p>
<h3>Go outside as often as possible during the day </h3>
<p>It sounds obvious but if you don’t feel comfortable moving around in the dark, then get outside during the day. Government guidelines recommend we do 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week, which equates to 21 minutes a day. Break that up into chunks, and that might mean heading outdoors for two 10-minute brisk walks – one 10 minutes before you start work, and one at lunchtime. Going for a midday walk may well help you to feel more <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/why-we-should-all-be-walking-during-our-lunch-breaks-according-to-psychologists/348240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">awake (even if it’s raining), alert and productive</a>. </p>
<h3>Save your cardio workouts for the weekend</h3>
<p>There’s no easy solution to feeling safe while running in the dark. If you don’t have someone to run with, you might just decide that it’s not worth the risk – a totally valid decision. Rather than pushing through or berating yourself for not having the confidence to strap on a head torch, save those workouts for the weekend. You might not like the idea of ‘wasting’ your Sunday morning schlepping along a canal, but if you choose a bakery to run to or make a pub roast your final destination, then suddenly it becomes more of an occasion. I usually run to an outdoor market that offers a useful (and tasty) pit-stop at 7k into a 10k loop – well worth braving, even in the drizzle. </p>
<h3>Prioritise low-impact workouts </h3>
<p>Kic co-founder and CEO Laura Henshaw says that during the winter, the app sees a spike in lower-impact workouts like pilates because “when you’re lacking motivation, it’s much easier to commit to slower, more nuturing exercises”. The most popular workouts, she says, are five-to-15-minutes long. </p>
<p>I don’t do much yoga in the summer, but in the winter, there’s nothing like a really cosy yin session in the evenings. I’ve also started doing pilates on Monday afternoons, and it’s one class I actively make time for. I know I’ll feel good afterwards and it doesn’t require having a great gush of energy to get started. Again, there are plenty of yoga and pilates sessions on YouTube. Check out Yoga with Adriene for a yoga class to suit every emotion or goal, and Isa Welly is incredible for brilliant pilates sessions.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/easy-quick-healthy-lifestyle-tips/787868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living a healthy lifestyle</a> is rarely about making big, life-altering changes. As much as we’d all love a magic pill that would improve our gut health, increase our cardiovascular fitness and support our immune system, it’s the small decisions we make daily that will make a difference in the long run. </p>
<p>When it comes to looking after your <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/better-heart-health-tips/782524" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heart health</a>, one of the best small changes you can make is reducing the amount of time you spend sitting down. We all know how dangerous a sedentary lifestyle can be for our health, primarily because of the impact it can have on our heart; <a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/risk-factors/physical-inactivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inactivity can lead to fatty deposits building up in our arteries</a>, increasing our risk of a heart attack or stroke.  </p>
<p>The good news, however, is that you don’t need to be running marathons to reap the benefits of activity for your heart health. According to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad717/7343176?login=false#423577086" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new study</a>, even taking a nap could make a difference. </p>
<p>The study, supported by the British Heart Foundation and published in the <i>European Heart Journal</i>, is the first to assess how different patterns of movement throughout the day can affect heart health.  </p>
<p>The analysis of six studies – which were based on the data of over 15,000 people – measured the impact of moderate-vigorous and light activity, as well as standing and sleeping, compared to sedentary periods, on a range of metrics including BMI, waist circumference, and HDL cholesterol levels. These metrics were then used to assess the overall impact of the activities on heart health.  </p>
<p>Once they’d got all this data in line, the team set about modelling what would happen to someone’s heart health if they were to change various periods of their behaviour for a different type of activity for a week. Not only did they find that as little as five minutes of moderate-vigorous activity had a noticeable effect on heart health, but also that near-sedentary activities like sleeping and standing are better for you than simply sitting.  </p>
<p>While this doesn’t mean sleeping all day long is going to <i>benefit</i> your heart health, it does mean that napping is likely better for your heart than simply lounging on the sofa (which is good news for those of us who love <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/sleep/napping-how-to-nap-sleep-advice-insomnia/336807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a midday snooze</a>).</p>
<p>However, if you want to truly look after your heart, you’ll need to incorporate more movement into your routine. You don’t need to spend hours pacing up and down the street, but taking breaks from sitting at your desk throughout the day – whether that’s by <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/does-housework-count-as-exercise/815710" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">putting the washing out</a>, going for a walk or doing some cleaning – can make a big difference to what’s going on inside.  </p>

<p>The NHS has <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/exercise-guidelines/physical-activity-guidelines-for-adults-aged-19-to-64/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clear physical activity guidelines</a> for people aged 19-64 that are designed to help us avoid the negative impact of sitting down too much while also reaping the benefits of exercise.  </p>
<p>They state that adults should aim to: </p>
<ul>
<li>do strengthening activities that work all the major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms) at least twice a week </li>
<li>do at least 150 minutes of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/how-to-improve-fitness-health/561251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moderate-intensity activity</a> a week or 75 minutes of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/is-working-out-one-day-a-week-enough-to-keep-you-fit/494476" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vigorous-intensity</a> activity a week </li>
<li>spread exercise evenly over four to five days a week, or every day </li>
<li>reduce time spent sitting or lying down and break up long periods of not moving with some activity </li>
</ul>
<p>The guidelines also state that you can achieve the weekly target with several short sessions of ‘very vigorous’ intensity activity (such as HIIT and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/10-20-30-intervals-how-to-run-faster/835284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interval running</a>) or a mix of moderate, vigorous and very vigorous intensity activity. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Winter is coming, and if you’re anything like us, you might be feeling a little low energy. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18848402/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studies</a> have shown that seasonal affective disorder (SAD) can lead to feelings of demotivation, so it’s normal to find yourself slowing down as the holidays approach.</p>
<p>Many of us are conditioned to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/doing-nothing-guilt/640232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feel guilty if we end up doing absolutely nothing</a> for a day. After all, amid a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/hustle-culture-habits-burnout/657222" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hustle culture</a> where <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/productivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">productivity </a>rules, doing zilch is seen as a waste of time. </p>
<p>But here’s the truth: doing nothing is good for you. It’s certainly of value; in fact, it’s essential. </p>
<p>Chris Griffiths and Caragh Medlicott are the authors of <i>The Creative Thinking Handbook</i>. They reckon that doing nothing can be productive – you just need to reframe it. </p>
<p>“When you have a to-do list as long as your arm and a million errands to run, the productive power of doing nothing probably sounds like a lovely, slightly unhinged fantasy,” Griffiths and Medlicott tell <i>Stylist</i>. “It’s true that doing nothing alone won’t help you get more things done, but when you use the power of doing nothing correctly, it can actually increase your productivity and boost your energy so you can better tackle a heavy workload.”</p>
<p>The key to the power of doing nothing is… doing <i>nothing</i>. Not scrolling TikTok. Not watching <i>The White Lotus</i>. Not half-doing email admin, and half beating yourself up in your mind. </p>
<p>You need to be doing “just plain old nothing”, say Griffiths and Medlicott. “Or at the very least, almost nothing: a mundane, repetitive task that is neither entertaining nor demanding of your attention.”</p>
<section class="pp-article__boxout">
<div id="boxout_1" class="pp-boxout" style="background-color:#606060;">
<div class="pp-boxout__body">
<h4>You wouldn’t expect your phone to run without a charge</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>Why? It’s all down to what doing nothing does to your brain, which is to enable it to completely relax and rest. Once your brain is in that space, it can go on to be more creative and energised, as well as allowing you to better solve problems. Let’s break down the science. </p>
<p>Griffiths and Medlicott explain: “Our brains are incredibly complex machines, and depending on what you’re doing, different parts fire up. For a long time, scientists assumed that our brains were most active when we were doing focused work. You can see the logic behind this. When you’re concentrating, you’re surely using more brain power, right? Well, it turns out that’s not quite the case. </p>
<p>“Research from the University of British Columbia found that when we concentrate, our brains operate more like spotlights than light bulbs. With our attention on just one thing, our brain’s usage narrows in order to give full energy to the task at hand. What’s even more interesting is what happens when we kick back and let the mind wander.</p>
<p>“Where once scientists had believed that it was just the brain’s basic ‘default network’ that was engaged when we went into daydreaming mode, we now know that it actually causes large parts of the brain to light up – including the brain’s executive network (the part associated with complex problem solving and ideation). </p>
<p>“While this can all sound quite technical in theory, you’ve more than likely experienced this phenomenon firsthand. Have you ever had an idea strike you in the middle of the night or stumbled upon the perfect solution to a problem while on the drive to work? If it often seems that our best ideas appear when we’re thinking about something else entirely, that’s because it truly is the case. One study even found that 72% of people report experiencing interesting new ideas while taking a shower. </p>
<p>“By taking time away from work to do nothing, you’re actually increasing the time your brain spends unpicking problems and making crucial connections. Thus allowing you to tackle your work with fresh creative verve.” </p>
<p>The power of doing nothing isn’t just in giving yourself space for ideas to strike, however. It’s in being able to rest and recharge. </p>
<section class="pp-article__boxout">
<div id="boxout_1" class="pp-boxout" style="background-color:#606060;">
<div class="pp-boxout__body">
<h4>Regular breaks help to prevent stress and overwhelm</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>Griffiths and Medlicott note: “You wouldn’t expect your laptop or phone to keep running without charge, so why do you expect endless productivity from your brain?</p>
<p>“Countless studies have shown that regular breaks help to prevent stress and overwhelm. When we have a lot to do, spending time doing nothing sounds counterintuitive, but by avoiding breaks you only cause the depletion of your energy reserves to happen even faster. </p>
<p>“In our techy world, many of us are tempted to spend our breaks away from work still plugged in and logged on – whether answering messages or checking social media – but while these things may feel like they require less energy, they don’t have the same rejuvenating power of truly doing nothing.”</p>
<p>You can’t do nothing all the time – it’d get boring pretty quickly. But carving out small windows where you can just sit down, ditch your screens and let yourself be is good for you. It’s good for your brain and good for making you more productive in the long run. So, if you find yourself slowing down with winter approaching, there’s no need to fight it. No more feeling guilty for a weekend spent doing nothing – it’s vital. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The moment you feel a cold coming on, what do you do? Chances are, you’ll suddenly start popping Barocca (or some other vitamin C supplement) and looking into zinc capsules. Where once our grandmas might have prescribed hot toddies and honey, we’re way more clued up about the role vitamins and minerals play in immunity. But what if we’ve actually got it all wrong?</p>
<p>Given that the supplement industry is set to be worth £214 billion by 2024, it’s clear that a lot of us are turning to powders, shakes and pills to get our vitamins. And if you’re one of them, you might be distressed to find out that scientists tend to think that most vitamins and supplements are a “waste of money”&nbsp;– especially when it comes to fighting disease.</p>
<p>Scientists from Northwestern University say that for non-pregnant, healthy people, there’s not enough evidence to suggest that supplements can prevent illness. In a <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/06/220621114707.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report published in <i>JAMA</i></a><i></i>, Dr Jeffrery Linder, chief of general internal medicine in the university’s department of medicine, says that people are “wasting money and focus thinking there has to be a magic set of pills that will keep them healthy when we should all be following the evidence-based practices of eating healthy and exercising”.</p>
<p>If that wasn’t enough of a kick to those of us who do supplement, a clinical professor at the University of Georgia then <a href="https://www.insider.com/supplements-vitamins-that-are-useless-common-in-diet-nutrition-experts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <i>Insider</i></a><i></i> that vitamins A, C, B and zinc are the most “useless” supplements to take because most people are already getting enough through their diets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, are we really wasting our hard-earned money on supplementing for nothing?</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>

<p>Reema Patel, registered dietitian and nutritionist for&nbsp;<a href="https://dietitianfit.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dietitian Fit and Co</a>, tells <i>Strong Women</i>: “Generally,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/vitamins-supplements-guide-take-buy/403318" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can get many of the vitamins you need</a> from your diet alone, so there is often little to no need to supplement. Some vitamins are easily obtained from foods that we regularly eat, such as antioxidants (vitamins A, C and E), which are found abundantly in fruits and vegetables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“However there will be some vitamins that need a bit more consideration to obtain enough in the diet.”</p>
<p>The NHS, for example, recommends that everyone in the UK takes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/vitamin-d-benefits-types-deficiency-levels-best-supplements-foods/372104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vitamin D</a>&nbsp;during the winter months. “And if you’re vegan, there are some important vitamins to consider supplementing that can be hard to find in a vegan diet generally, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/vitamin-b12-tired-or-b12-deficient/542370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">such as B12</a>,” says Patel.</p>
<h2><\h2><p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136969/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2011 meta-analysis review</a>, published in the <i>Open Respiratory Medicine Journal</i>, that found that zinc lozenges reduced the duration of cold symptoms by 48%. That same year, a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21328251/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cochrane review</a> looked at 13 randomised placebo-controlled trials that all examined the effect of taking zinc soon after the onset of cold symptoms. It concluded that there was convincing evidence to suggest that zinc does “significantly reduce both the duration and severity of symptoms”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Some research has shown that having adequate levels of zinc and vitamin C can help shorten the duration of colds, but this does not mean we are able to avoid them completely just by increasing our levels of zinc and vitamin C,” Patel explains. In other words, take zinc if you have a cold, not to prevent a cold.</p>

<h4>You can’t avoid colds completely by increasing zinc and vitamin C levels</h4>
<p>Reema Patel</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>But, she also says that you’re still better off trying to eat it, rather than supplement: “Vitamin C is generally easily obtainable in the diet from fruits and vegetables, and zinc is readily found from meat, fish, wholegrains and milk as well as nuts and beans, so it is rarely necessary that we need to supplement with these nutrients.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, the way we think about colds is probably wrong in general. <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/how-to-prevent-illness-festival/675013" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Ross Perry previously debunked </a>the myth that you can catch a cold in wet weather, explaining that: “Viruses and bacteria cause infections, and these are likely to be transmitted from person to person by inhaling them in the form of air droplets from a sneeze or a cough.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that in mind, it probably makes sense that simply taking extra vitamins isn’t going to protect you from breathing in someone else’s disease.</p>

<h2><\h2><p>“Where possible, we should aim to meet our nutritional requirements from food,” Patel advises. However, if you are someone who really does struggle to eat fruit and vegetables regularly, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/boost-energy-improve-sleep-immunity-multivitamin-supplements/643500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taking a multivitamin may be helpful to prevent deficiencies</a>.”</p>
<p>If you are vegan, however, then you do really need to think about supplementation – and not just for B12. “Vegans may need to be more aware of certain nutrients such as omega 3 fatty acids, iodine, selenium, iron, calcium and vitamin D, as these nutrients can be harder to obtain from a vegan diet.” It’s worth saying that even then, you can get twice your daily requirement of selenium from a single Brazil nut, walnuts are loaded with omega-3 and pecans are a good source of calcium. But it’s a little harder to find plant sources of iron, iodine and vitamin D.</p>
<p>As ever, chat with your GP before taking a new supplement and it’s worth asking to have your levels checked before trying something new. If you have low energy, you might need to supplement iron, for example, but you’re only going to know if it’s a waste of money or not if you know for certain that you’re anaemic. </p>
<p>TL;DR, not all supplements are a waste of money but we should be aiming for a food-first approach to nutrition.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/election" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general election</a> likely to <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainer/next-general-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">take place within the next 12 months</a>, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/rishi-sunak" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rishi Sunak</a>, the prime minister, has today announced significant changes to the government, including Suella Braverman’s departure as home secretary.</p>
<p>In a post on the Conservative party’s social media, it is claimed that Sunak’s cabinet reshuffle “strengthens his team in government to deliver long-term decisions for a brighter future” after <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/985764/voting-intention-in-the-uk/#:~:text=In%20November%202023%2C%2047%20percent,Liz%20Truss%20came%20to%20power." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent opinion surveys</a> in the UK showed the Labour party currently leading the polls.</p>
<h3>Who has been appointed as home secretary?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/news/politics/suella-braverman-benefits-expenses/682484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suella Braverman</a> was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-67401753" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sacked as home secretary</a> after the prime minister came under pressure to remove her from office following a series of inflammatory remarks. Over the weekend, figures including Sadiq Khan urged Sunak to act after accusing her of riling up the far-right amid political protests. The Mayor of London said violent clashes involving counter-protesters were a “direct result” of the home secretary’s words, after she accused the Metropolitan police of bias towards “pro-Palestinian mobs”.</p>
<p>Braverman also came under fire for proposing new laws to restrict the use of tents by homeless people, arguing that many of them see it as a “lifestyle choice”. In response to her plan to introduce new penalties for homeless people who authorities believe have rejected offers of help, housing charity Shelter said: “Nobody should be punished for being homeless.”</p>

<p>In a statement released after her sacking, Braverman said: “It has been the greatest privilege of my life to serve as home secretary. I will have more to say in due course.” James Cleverly, who had been foreign secretary, has been moved to take over the Home Office brief.</p>
<h3>Who has been appointed as foreign secretary?</h3>
<p>Shortly after Braverman’s exit, David Cameron, the former prime minister, was appointed foreign secretary  and handed a barony so he can serve in government again. Cameron is not currently an MP or a member of the House of Lords after stepping down in 2016.</p>
<p>“The prime minister has asked me to serve as his foreign secretary and I have gladly accepted,” he shared in a statement on X (formerly Twitter). </p>
<p>“We are facing a daunting set of international challenges, including the war in Ukraine and the crisis in the Middle East. At this time of profound global change, it has rarely been more important for this country to stand by our allies, strengthen our partnerships and make sure our voice is heard.</p>

<p>“While I have been out of front-line politics for the last seven years, I hope that my experience – as Conservative leader for 11 years and prime minister for six – will assist me in helping the prime minister to meet these vital challenges.”</p>
<p>Among the other changes, Will Quince, a health minister, also announced that he is stepping down from his government role. Quince, who is not standing at the next general election, said in a letter to Rishi Sunak that “now feels like the right time to leave HM government”. </p>
<p>Jeremy Hunt will remain as chancellor of the exchequer, Downing Street has said. </p>
