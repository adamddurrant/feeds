			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Itâ€™s always tough deciding what to watch on TV, especially as thereâ€™s just so many things to choose from. Thatâ€™s why a show tends to shoot its way to the top of our must-watchlist if it has already proven itself to be something of a resounding success overseas.Â </p>
<p><i>Tracker</i>, which has been crowned the most-watched new series on US broadcast TV in six years and the most-watched new drama series in nine years, definitely fits the bill.</p>
<p><b>Watch the trailer for <i>Tracker </i>below:</b></p>
<p class="stylist-youtube"><div class="iframely-youtube iframely-player iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="Tracker Season 1 Extended Trailer" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/XYYFvdK?maxheight=1200" data-img allowfullscreen scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture *; web-share *;"></iframe></div></div></p><p>Yes, itâ€™s another tale of a nomadic hero. Yes, itâ€™s giving us <i>Jack Reacher </i>vibes. And yes, <i>Selling Sunset</i> fans: that <i>is </i>Justin Hartley. </p>
<p>Intrigued? Hereâ€™s what you need to know.</p>
<h3>What is <i>Tracker </i>about?</h3>
<p>Based on the bestselling novel <i>The Never Game</i> by Jeffery Deaver, Tracker tells the story of Colter Shaw, a â€œa lone-wolf survivalist who roams the country as a reward seeker, using his expert tracking skills to help private citizens and law enforcement solve all manner of mysteries while contending with his own fractured familyâ€.</p>
<p>So, heâ€™s a bounty hunter. And, in typical procedural drama fashion, this means we get a â€œmystery of the weekâ€ with each episode â€“ as our troubled lead struggles to make sense of his traumatic past (while whipping his shirt off at every opportunity and showing off his comprehensive mastery of survival percentages, of course). </p>
<h3>Who stars in <i>Tracker</i>?</h3>
<p><i>This Is Us </i>star Justin Hartley, as mentioned already, takes the lead in this one as our eponymous tracker.Â </p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Tracker" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2024/03/27213802/tracker_101_492775_119160_02514b-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Disney+</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Heâ€™s joined by Abby McEnany and Robin Weigert as Velma and Teddi Bruin, Eric Graise as Bobby Exley, and Fiona Rene as attorney/love interest Reenie Greene.</p>
<h3>What are people saying about <i>Tracker</i>?</h3>
<p>With an 88% â€˜freshâ€™ rating on Rotten Tomatoes, it seems Tracker has gone down an absolute treat with fans of the genre.</p>
<p>Admitting that he fell in love with his character, Hartley tells <i><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/tracker-premiere-justin-hartley-this-is-us-texts-interview-1235822267/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/tracker-premiere-justin-hartley-this-is-us-texts-interview-1235822267/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i>: â€œWhat an amazing idea of a life, where you live in an Airstream, youâ€™re self-sustaining, go wherever you want to go and help people. Youâ€™re not an antihero, youâ€™re just a good guy, a good man.â€</p>
<p>He adds: â€œI guess it made me think about how rare that is. I remember sitting there thinking heâ€™s just a good guy. Colter Shaw is not agenda-driven, necessarily. Heâ€™s a businessman. He takes the money, thatâ€™s how he makes his living. Heâ€™s not politically driven. Heâ€™s driven by doing the right thingâ€¦ [and]  he is not a superhero; heâ€™s living a very dangerous life. If he gets shot, he bleeds, he will die.</p>
<p>â€œI think itâ€™s a throwback series, sort of like <i>The Rockford Files</i>. We just donâ€™t have that anymore and I get nostalgic about that kind of television.â€</p>
<h3>When and where can we watch <i>Tracker</i>?</h3>
<p>The first episode of <i>Tracker </i>will be released on Disney+ in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Wednesday 3 April 2024, and new episodes will be released weekly.</p>
<p>Will you be tuning in?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As spring comes into focus and the sun is finally shining, it is time to add some bold colour to your wardrobe. Lipstick red hues were all over the spring/summer 2024 catwalks â€“ Valentino showed clean line column dresses, while Dior used red to enhance an elegantly tailored skirt suit. The colour also looks set to dominate for autumn/winter 2024, as evidenced by designers like Simone Rocha and Erdem in London and Ferragamo and Jil Sander in Milan. So shop smart and invest now to wear all year.   </p>
<p>This statement red is such a dynamic colour, it will give an instant lift to your look and spirits, too. The most chic lipstick red pieces for this season are simply tailored, without extra adornment. Wear with monochrome separates or <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/mid-wash-denim-best-jeans-shirts-dresses/857181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mid-wash denim</a> for a contemporary take on this hue. Equally, a top-to-toe red outfit always works, either for an event or important work day â€“ itâ€™s a great option as it looks great and always exudes confidence.  </p>
<p>Although <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/bold-red-how-to-wear/848129" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bold red</a> can seem intimidating to style, our team will show you the key pieces from Whistles, Zara and H&M that everyone is going to want. Read on for our top high street picks, available online now.Â </p></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was offered the chance to have a near-infrared scanner reveal the true health of my hair, I was absolutely intrigued. What beauty devotee wouldnâ€™t want to know exactly what state their strands are inÂ â€“ and how to help them improve?</p>
<p>Philipp Haug, of <a href="https://www.hauglondon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haug London Haus</a>,Â describes the<a href="https://www.salonlab-server.de/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Schwarzkopf Professional SalonLab Smart Analyzer</a>Â as an X-ray, for the sake of simplicity. </p>
<p>It was at this salon â€“ which Haug founded with his business partner and wife, Siobhan HaugÂ â€“ that I gave the tech and the subsequent recommended treatment and products a try. They donâ€™t charge extra for this scanning service, offering it to every new client as standard, to gain a better idea of a customerâ€™s unique needs. </p>
<p>The scanner is a small handheld tool that allows a stylist to scan hair from root to tip, via a light beam that calculates the reflection of light from the hairâ€™s outer cuticle, thus measuring the inner hair condition and strength.Â </p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Aidan's hair health score" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2024/03/27164158/aidans-hair-health-score-1120x1120.jpeg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Schwarzkopf</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Customersâ€™ hair is then given a score out of 100 and the salon recommends a tailored treatment, including a selection of products either custom-blended and shipped to you, or taken straight off the salon shelves (plus, if youâ€™re taking that plunge, a colour that suits your specific hair needs). I went with a tailored treatment on the day, and also took home some non-custom-blended wash day and styling supplies. </p>
<p>The Haugsâ€™ process also involves a survey to help your stylist determine your hair type, the state of your scalp and your haircare priorities (options include â€œrepair and nourishmentâ€, â€œcolour shine and brillianceâ€, and â€œvolume and strengthâ€). Until I was asked, I had never really thought of<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/big-hair-volume-trend/867681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> volume being a big priority</a> to me. After all, Iâ€™ve got naturally big, thick <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/best-products-for-curly-hair-shampoo-conditioner-mousse-curl-cream/381517" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">curly hair</a>, so flatness or fineness isnâ€™t my struggle; itâ€™s <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/best-moisturising-curly-hair-products/870658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moisture</a> that I really craved. </p>
<p>But when I actually thought about it, I realised <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/frizzy-hair-2/844650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I love volume</a> so much that I constantly want more. Iâ€™m always fluffing up my hair during the day, to help it be as big as possible, and smooth ringlets just arenâ€™t my vibe. Instead, if I feel like my curls are too tidy, I separate them a little to add a bit of 80s-inspired fluff. On top of that, curly hair can be dry and prone to breakage, and Iâ€™m trying to grow it as much as possible for my looming wedding, so Iâ€™ll take all the strength I can get.Â </p>

<p>So, to my surprise, â€œvolume and strengthâ€ is the option I chose. And Iâ€™m so happy I did, because â€“ if I do say so myselfÂ â€“ you can see from the before and after photos above that my treatment left my hair looking <i>fantastic</i>, with just the right amount of volume, moisture and structured curl.</p>
<p>My chosen preferences also helped inform the selection of shampoo, conditioner and styling products I was recommended after the treatment. I walked away with the Schwarzkopf Professional Fibre Clinix Volumize Shampoo and Conditioner, the Fibre Clinix Bonding Light Oil and the Fibre Clinix Fibre Clinix Hydrate Spray Conditioner, the latter of which I use to style my hair on and between wash days. </p>
<p>Iâ€™m obsessed with these products, and wouldnâ€™t have considered giving most of them a try if it werenâ€™t for this process becauseÂ â€“ in addition to never having thought consciously about adding volumeÂ â€“ Iâ€™ve never got on with an oil the way I have with this one. Itâ€™s light, it smells amazing and is perfect for between washes, when my hair needs a bit of moisture to help it through the day.</p>

</figure>
<p>And my strength score? An impressive 74%, which is way higher than I thought I would get, considering I put a box dye on my hair less than six months ago.</p>
<p>â€œ74% is a really good score,â€ says Haug, â€œand with antioxidant products, the score would go up. The small damage you have would be due to external factors like the sun and the lack of ozone in the atmosphere now, causing free radicals to break down the bonds in the hair if itâ€™s not protected. Itâ€™s a bit like exposing the skin to the sun without an SPF.â€</p>
<p>Haug added that products like the Fibre Clinix oils, shampoos and conditioners â€œcontain the bonds to replace those that are broken and re-strengthen the hairâ€.</p>
<p>Sun damage to my hair is another thing I would never have spent much time thinking about â€“ my main worry was the impact of the box dye. But now that I know to protect my precious bonds, Iâ€™ll make that a focus in my newfound quest for volume.Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every so often a piece of art is created that encapsulates the magic, tenderness, heartbreak, chaos and beauty of female friendships. Sometimes thatâ€™s a book (<i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/everything-i-know-about-love" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything I Know About Love</a></i>, anyone?) or an album (looking at you, Lorde). This time, itâ€™s a TV show, specifically Channel 4â€™s <i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/tv/nicola-coughlan-lydia-west-big-mood-channel-4/763860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Mood</a></i>. AndÂ â€“ you guessed it â€“itâ€™s a big, huge, colossal mood.</p>
<p>The series is written and created by playwright Camilla Whitehill, starring Nicola Coughlan (<i>Derry Girls</i>, <i>Bridgerton</i>) and Lydia West (<i>Itâ€™s A Sin</i>) as its leads. Whitehill has actually been friends with Coughlan since they met at drama school 15 years ago, and the pair have been wanting to work together on a project for a long time.</p>
<p>Maggie (Coughlan) and Eddie (West) live in Dalston, East London and are best friends. More than best friends, even, they are life partners and family. Some (me) might even go as far as to call them <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/codependency-relationship/628107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">codependent</a>.</p>
<p>The synopsis of <i>Big Mood</i> reads: â€œMaggie and Eddie have lived in each otherâ€™s pockets for ten years, through thick, thin, and multiple challenging eyebrow trends. But with the rest of their lives looming, careers hanging in the balance and Maggieâ€™s <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/bipolar-disorder-depression-manic-episodes-three-things-you-should-know-symptoms-signs/426155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bipolar disorder</a> making an unwelcome return to form, Eddie begins to question whether this friendship is really in their best interests.â€</p>
<div class="iframely-youtube iframely-player iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="Big Mood | Official Trailer" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/PlNxKP3?maxheight=1200" data-img allowfullscreen scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture *; web-share *;"></iframe></div></div><p>Ths synopsis further notes that this is â€œa pivotal point in both their lives, bringing to the surface those all-important questions â€“ could sleeping with your former History teacher be the key to happiness? Is a basement Rat Hotel a functional alternative to pest control? With their 20s behind them, Maggie and Eddieâ€™s relationship faces the future â€“ can it survive?â€</p>
<p>Throughout the six-part series we see Eddie grapple with her own needs as she tries to be the â€˜strong friendâ€™, a role she has both cast herself in and been cast in. We see Maggie try to stay afloat as her bipolar disorder takes control and she can do very little but try to survive. </p>
<p>Eddie rarely asks for anything, and she is always the one supporting, organising and rescuing Maggie from a multitude of shenanigans. At first, this is a fun adventure; they are the yin to each otherâ€™s yang. Then the cracks begin to show, as mental illness intertwines itself into their friendship â€“ Maggie becomes manic, depressed and has periods of memory loss. Eddie becomes frustrated after needing support (she loses the bar she runs and has to deal with an unplanned pregnancy) and not finding it in Maggie. The series ends with an open-ended friendship breakup, as Eddie steps into a cab and Maggie sobs on the pavement.</p>

<h4>Like Maggie, I have accidentally been selfish in friendshipsÂ </h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p><i>Big Mood</i> is a painfully relatable show. The language Eddie and Maggie use could have been lifted directly from my personal WhatsApp chats: â€œIf I could finally get a big Le Creuset things might turn aroundâ€, â€œMost perfect special angel girlâ€, and â€œI donâ€™t have Â£800 in my bank accountâ€¦ that would be <i>wild</i>â€. The most relatable part, however, is their friendship. And how I have been both an Eddie and a Maggie at different times in my life. Iâ€™m sure you have been, too.</p>
<p>Like Eddie, I have routinely been described as â€˜independentâ€™ and â€˜strongâ€™. Like Eddie, I have made outlandish statements like â€œIâ€™m the only one who can take care of meâ€ and â€œI donâ€™t need anyoneâ€. And, like Eddie, I have resented friendships where my needs were always secondary because the other person was in more of a â€˜crisisâ€™, and so I silently made myself a martyr.</p>
<p>Like Maggie, I have struggled with complex mental health which, at some stages, has taken over my life. Like Maggie, I have made outlandish statements like â€œIâ€™ve got depression down to a fine artâ€. And, like Maggie, I have accidentally been selfish in friendships because <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/comparison-culture-in-lockdown-thriving-vs-surviving/481927" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">survival mode</a> temporarily took away some of my self-awareness.</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Maggie (Nicola Coughlan) Eddie (Lydia West) in Big Mood" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/04/16102459/73854_s1_big-mood-first-looks-2-909x909.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Channel 4</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While itâ€™s clear that Maggie definitely fucks up more out of the pair, itâ€™s not so much her actions but her dishonesty that really makes the friendship go off the rails. When Eddie asks her â€œI need help. I need you to help me, Maggie, is that OK?â€, she should have said no and told her friend about the memory loss and hallucinations.</p>
<p>The truth is that mental health can detrimentally affect the relationships in our lives. That feels like saying the quiet bit out loud, but itâ€™s a reality we should not shy away from. If we wonâ€™t admit this to ourselves, how can we learn the tools to manage? How can we avoid our mental health ending friendships? How can we not â€˜doâ€™ a Maggie? People are not required to love you at your worst, despite what Marilyn Monroe may have said. Friendship is conditional, not unconditional, and your friends are allowed boundaries and limits. Just as you are.</p>
<p>However, this is not a show of absolutes or moral judgements. We are meant to sympathise and dislike both Eddie and Maggie at different times, because neither of them is â€˜perfectâ€™ at friendship. None of us are.</p>
<p>Art that reflects the powerful friendships between women has become mainstream in the last decade, and rightfully soÂ â€“ they are instrumental in society and deserve to be platformed. However, oftentimes only the joyful elements are portrayed, which can leave women feeling like theyâ€™re doing something wrong. Friendships are a relationship, and those will always be messy and require navigation. <i>Big Mood</i> is the finest representation of this truth that I have ever seen. Letâ€™s hope we get a second season.</p>

<p>â€œI first discovered Maison Francis Kurkdjian Ã€ La Rose Body Oil about seven years ago, when I was working on a red carpet premiere with Gal Gadot. Iâ€™d been gifted it, and when I used it on her I instantly fell in love with the fragrance. </p>
<p>â€œI always have one in my kit, because the scent is not too overpowering and it smells so girly and clean. The oil isnâ€™t too oily either â€“ itâ€™s quite a dry oil, so it can be used on the skin without worrying about your clothes getting any oil patches.</p>

<p>â€œI always give it to people for special occasions. It feels so luxurious, and because you can use it all over, you can smell it all day. Itâ€™s beautiful.</p>
<p>â€œI always apply it on slightly damp skin after a bath or shower, but when Iâ€™m using it on a celeb for the red carpet, I apply it well before they dress. You can use it sparingly â€“ a little goes a long way!â€</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lip liners are staple products in our make-up bags for good reason. Not only can they keep your lip colour in line, but they can also help take your lip shape to the next level. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.bobbibrown.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bobbi Brown</a>Â senior pro make-up artist Zara Findlay tells <i>Stylist</i>: â€œI love that lip liners give your lips the subtle definition to enhance your natural lip shape, and really make your lip colour or gloss pop. </p>
<p>â€œThey can give your unwanted lipsticks and glosses a new pop by changing their tone, and they can stop your lipsticks from feathering, as well as help them stay on for much longer.â€</p>
<h2>The best way to apply lip liner</h2>
<p>â€œIf you want to enhance your lips,â€ says Findlay, â€œuse a lip liner that is just a touch darker than your lip tone and follow the natural shape of your lips when lining them. I then like to use my fingertip to soften out the edges before I apply my lipstick or gloss. This is going to allow for a very seamless, natural look.</p>
<p>â€œYou can wear a lip liner with any lip product, whether itâ€™s a lipstick, gloss, stain or balm. Your lip liner is just there to enhance the natural shape of your lips.â€</p>
<h2>Lip liners to shop</h2>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Weâ€™ve made it. For many of us, the clock hitting 6pm (or even earlier) today will signal the start of the long-waited four-day weekend. And it doesnâ€™t matter what the weather has planned, weâ€™re going to enjoy our time off as much as we possibly can. But whatever your plans might be, we suggest fitting a long, lazy brunch into your agenda.</p>

<p>As much as we love classic scrambled eggs or avo and poached eggs, if youâ€™re looking for something different, weâ€™re turning to chef and food writer Ed Smith and his new cookbook,Â <i><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/4756/9781837831388" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Eggs</a></i>. Featuring over 100 recipes and ideas that make eggs the star of the show, the book promises all the inspiration you need, including recipes for fried, poached, boiled, baked, scrambled and more which work for breakfast through until dinner.</p>
<p>From a Dishoom-inspired dish to the flavours of Italy, these three recipes are perfect for the weekend ahead.Â </p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">Pizza baked eggs</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p><b>Ed says:</b> â€œThe base for these eggs echoes the flavours of a pizza alla marinara. Iâ€™ve added a few olives and anchovies at the end, partly because they go so well with eggs, but also because theyâ€™re the best pizza toppings (donâ€™t @ me).</p>
<p>For the bread, anything you have will work (although note that toasted supermarket pitas do an excellent impression of leftover pizza crusts).â€</p>
<p><i>For 2</i></p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1 x 400g can finely chopped tomatoes (or passata)</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, finely sliced</li>
<li>2 tsp dried oregano</li>
<li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil </li>
<li>6â€“8 small olives (such as the Taggiasca variety)</li>
<li>1 basil sprig, plus a few extra leaves to garnish </li>
<li>Pinch flaky sea salt</li>
<li>2â€“4 medium eggs</li>
<li>2â€“4 salted anchovies in oil</li>
<li>Freshly grated Parmesan</li>
<li>Warm bread, to serve (pitas or similar puffy flatbreads work well here)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Method</b></p>
<p>Empty the tomatoes into a 26â€“28cm sautÃ© pan or low casserole with a lid and place over a medium-high heat. Add the garlic, oregano, olive oil, olives, basil sprig and a big pinch of salt. Stir and simmer energetically for 5 minutes until slightly thickened (but not stiff).</p>
<p>Crack the eggs into the sauce, ideally far enough apart that they donâ€™t immediately touch each other. Reduce the heat a little, cover and gently simmer for 2Â½â€“3 minutes until the whites are set. Remove from the heat. If the whites arenâ€™t firm by this point, keep the pan off the hob, but return the lid and check again after 30â€“60 seconds.</p>
<p>Spoon the eggs and sauce into shallow bowls. Lay an anchovy over each egg and garnish with a few basil leaves and a dusting of Parmesan. Serve with warm bread for swiping.</p>
<p><b>Also consider:</b></p>
<p>Other additions to the sauce: â€™nduja; crumbled sausage meat; a handful of baby spinach; pepperoni at the point the lid goes on.</p>
<p>Other garnishes: capers; chilli oil; hot honey.</p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">Fried eggs in naan</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p><b>Ed says: </b>â€œThe freshness, pliability and quality of the bread makes or breaks an egg-filled naan. But when itâ€™s good, oh boy is it good. If you (as I am) are lucky enough to be able to source fresh naan locally, then do that. If not, then you can find plenty of recipes for making your own naan online, including Dishoomâ€™s (the British Bombay-inspired restaurant group, whose Bacon Naan Roll prompted my love of this particular form of Good Egg).â€</p>
<p><i>Per person</i></p>
<p><b>Anchovy, butter and parsley salad naan:Â </b></p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<ul>
<li>A handful of flat-leaf parsley leaves, roughly chopped</li>
<li>20g red onion or shallot, very finely sliced</li>
<li>1 tbsp moscatel or other white wine vinegar</li>
<li>1 fresh naan, warmed</li>
<li>1â€“2 fried eggs</li>
<li>Your preferred fat, for frying </li>
<li>5â€“10g butter, in slices</li>
<li>4â€“5 salted anchovies in oil</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Method</b></p>
<p>Combine the parsley, onion and vinegar in a small bowl â€“ set this to one side while you warm the naan and fry your egg(s).</p>
<p>Arrange the butter slices and anchovies over one half of the warm naan. Add the parsley salad and top with egg(s). Fold the naan to close it, then cut in two to serve.</p>
<p><b>Dishoom-style bacon and egg naan</b></p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1 fresh naan, warmed</li>
<li>1 tbsp full-fat cream cheese</li>
<li>1 tbsp spiced tomato chutney</li>
<li>2 rashers cooked bacon</li>
<li>A few coriander (cilantro) leaves</li>
<li>1â€“2 fried eggs</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Method</b></p>
<p>Spread one half of the warm naan with cream cheese, add the chutney, and arrange the bacon and coriander on top. Top with the fried egg(s), fold the naan to close it, then cut in two to serve.</p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">Poached eggs with 'nduja butter and spinach</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p><b>Ed says:</b> â€œCalabrian â€™nduja is fiery, fruity and salty. Ideal with eggs, then. It mellows a little once incorporated into melted butter â€“ although admittedly that is still a rich combination; even more so when joined by molten egg yolk. But thereâ€™s balance here, with the ooze offset by the purity of the poached whites, plus a soft bed of spinach and English muffins, which soak everything up. Glorious.â€</p>
<p><i>For 2</i></p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<ul>
<li>35g â€™nduja</li>
<li>20gÂ  unsalted butter, plus extra for the muffins</li>
<li>200g baby spinach</li>
<li>Flaky sea salt and ground black pepper </li>
<li>2 English muffins, halved and toasted</li>
<li>4 eggs</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Method</b></p>
<p>Gently melt the â€™nduja and butter together in a small saucepan over a very low heat. Prod and stir until combined. The sauce should be loose and glossy â€“ donâ€™t let this boil or fry, otherwise the pork in the â€™nduja hardens and the butter and sauce will split. Remove from direct heat while you assemble the other components.</p>
<p>Wilt the spinach in a large sautÃ© or frying pan (skillet) set over a medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of water to encourage the cooking process (no need for butter or oil thereâ€™s enough already in this dish). Once cooked, squeeze away any excess liquid. Season generously with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, toast and butter the muffins and poach the eggs (page 60).</p>
<p>Serve, topping the toasted muffins with mounds of spinach and the poached eggs. Give the â€™nduja butter a good stir, then spoon over the top.</p>
<p><b><br />
Also consider:</b></p>
<p>Replacing â€™nduja with Mallorcan sobrasada. There are also some vegan â€™nduja products, if you want to remove meat from this dish.</p>
<p>Thick-cut, toasted sourdough, ciabatta or crumpets instead of muffins. Spooning the sauce over fried eggs.</p>

Many of us are curious to know what the stars have in store for us on any given day or month. And whether we believe in it or not, we find ourselves ascribing our personality traits or behaviours to our star signs â€“ and I say that as a Scorpio.</p>
<p>Another thing about astrology, however, is that itâ€™s also aesthetically beautiful. The stars, constellations and intricate designs of each star signâ€™s symbol would make great additions to any home.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ve rounded up some of our favourite zodiac-inspired homeware pieces so you can add a touch of astrological charm in your spaceâ€¦</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If seeing a new colourway of the Samba on Instagram (hello, burgundy) sends you into a frenzied search for your size, youâ€™re not alone. Seen on the feet of Hailey Bieber and Bella Hadid, along with fashion editors and influencers alike, the power of these go-with-everything kicks is as strong as ever in 2024. But they arenâ€™t the only styles weâ€™ve been lusting after: elsewhere, Salomonâ€™s XT-6 trainers (a favourite of East London satire account <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/long-reads/real-housewives-of-clapton-instagram/807232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Housewives of Clapton</a>), New Balance 550 and Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66 all reached cult status last year and continue to coveted.</p>
<p>If, however, youâ€™re casting your eyes forward to what might come next before you click â€˜add to cartâ€™, then youâ€™re in luck â€“ weâ€™ve enlisted the help of women in the know  (from sneakerheads to fashion trend forecasters) to determine the styles that will be massive in 2024.</p></p>

<p>According to Rachel Makar, senior director at <a href="https://stockx.com/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StockX</a>, sporty nostalgia is on the horizon. â€œBe prepared to see more people serving all-white looks as tennis silhouettes are set to be a key trend this year. From Wimbledon to Zendayaâ€™s latest film, <i>Challengers</i>, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/tennis-fashion-dress-skirt-jumper/790144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tenniscore</a> is expected to have a similar impact as soccer silhouettes last year,â€ she says. â€œOn StockX, we have already seen a 35% YoY increase in trades on tennis shoes, including Nike Trainer 1 and Adidas Stan Smith.â€ Yep, thatâ€™s right: the Stan Smiths I loved in 2015 are making a big comeback a decade later.Â </p>
<p>So, whether you swap your rainbow Gazelles for a throwback Stan Smith, your Salomons for a pair of La Sportiva (more on these rising stars later)Â or your yellow Onitsuka Tigers for a pair in futuristic silver, these are the styles to buy now before they inevitably sell out.</p>
<h3>New Balance 1906Â </h3>
<p>When you think of New Balance, their chunky â€˜dadâ€™ style trainers most likely come to mind (a recent ad for the 990s even reads â€œworn by supermodels in London and Dads in Ohioâ€). But whatâ€™s the brandâ€™s latest style getting insiders all excited? â€œThe 1906 have got my heart this year,â€ shares <i>Stylist </i>columnist, freelance brand consultant and trainer lover <a href="https://www.instagram.com/billie_bhatia/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Billie Bhatia</a>. â€œThere is a real demand for performance-looking trainers to wear casually, and these tick all those boxes â€“ plus the metallic colourway brings a fashion-forward feeling to the trainers.â€</p>
<p>When it comes to ways to wear them this season, Billie suggests incorporating them into your weekend wear. â€œIâ€™ll be wearing mine with leather trousers, an oversized chunky knit and sunnies for the rest of spring,â€ she says.Â </p></p>

<h3>Adidas Stan Smith</h3>
<p>You might associate Stan Smiths with 2015/16, when they were <i>everywhere</i>: even the queen of stiletto heels, Victoria Beckham, was seen sporting a pair for New York Fashion Week back then. But now, almost a decade later (and 60 years after they were first created), theyâ€™re back on the fashion scene. Thanks to tenniscore, Iâ€™ve seen editors and influencers alike digging out their old pairs in recent months. And so, I predict â€“ along with all the other Sambas â€“ that these Adidas classics with continue to surge in 2024, especially for minimalists. See you on the court!Â </p>

<h3>Nike CortezÂ </h3>
<p>If youâ€™ve watched <i>Forrest Gump</i>, you may recognise these Nike trainers as the pair worn by Forrest for his casual 15,000 mile run (the exact pair recently sold at auction for $57,000). Now in 2024, The Cortez is being unboxed on Instagram as a must-have trainer style. According to Sanne Poeze, aka <a href="https://www.instagram.com/girlonkicks/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@girlonkicks</a>Â and author of <a href="https://studio96publishing.com/products/she-kicks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">She KicksÂ </a>(a coffee table book highlighting women who are making waves in the sneaker world), these are the kicks to have on your radar<i>.Â </i>â€œI think styles like the Nike Cortez and other vintage-inspired styles like the Puma Palermo are going to be a thing in line with the 90s-revival weâ€™re seeing elsewhere. In terms of colourways, muted colours are popular with this style.â€</p></p>

<h3>Nike Nocta Hot Step 2</h3>
<p>Thereâ€™s been no shortage of bright, bold trainers for the last few seasons â€“ and dopamine kicks are continuing to be key well into 2024. Already spotted on the streets during fashion month, the Nocta Hot Step 2 in zesty orange in collaboration with Drake are set to be everywhere this year. â€œChunky trainers arenâ€™t going out of style anytime soon and I predict that the Nike x Nocta will be popular in 2024,â€ says sneakerhead and content creator <a href="@_kristinek" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kai Kho</a>. â€œTheyâ€™re the perfect silhouette and I love how I can easily add them to any outfit when Iâ€™m in a rush.â€</p>
<p>Kai adds: â€œIâ€™ll be styling them with straight pants and a baggy T-shirt with an oversized jacket or with a hoodie/sweater and oversized joggers for a cosy look.â€</p></p>

<h3>Puma SpeedyCat</h3>
<p>According to influencer <a href="@selmacasisebbagh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selma Kaci</a>, a re-release of a 90s classic will be the next big shoe of 2024. First created back in 1999, the Puma SpeedCat turned speedtrack-inspired trainers into street style favourites. This year, model Emily Ratajkowsi has already been spotted wearing a red pair with a black mini dress â€“ and theyâ€™re about to be re-released. â€œPuma has been teasing the launch of a new SpeedyCat set to drop in June this year,â€ says Selma. â€œTheyâ€™re a similar shape toÂ Onitsuka Tiger, but where the Onitsuka Tiger is rising star the SpeedCat is still quite niche, and so lesser-known. I think Puma is about to take over from OT when it comes to sneakers.â€</p>

<h3>Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66</h3>
<p>As the second most-popular trainer of 2023 (after the Adidas Samba, of course), you may have already heard of the Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66. A celebrity favourite, theyâ€™re worn by Hailey Bieber, Bella Hadid and Kaia Gerber, and are setÂ to stick around for 2024, albeit with a new colourway on the scene. â€œRetro low-rise sneakers are emerging as a significant trend in 2024, undergoing a transformation with thinner sole units and a nostalgic aesthetic,â€ says chief commercial and sustainability officer at Mytheresa, Richard Johnson. But it wonâ€™t be the yellow youâ€™re clamouring for this year, but rather the brandâ€™s futuristic silver version. With the likes of ASICS, New Balance and Gola all creating silver pairs of their classic styles this season, metallics are set to be the colour of the year when it comes to footwear.</p>

<h3>La Sportiva TX4</h3>
<p>Itâ€™s not often function meets fashion, so when it does, itâ€™s time to listen up. Hiking shoes are the unlikely styles that are soaring, thanks to practical, outdoorsy outfits being part of the all-things-Y2K revival. Salomonâ€™s practical, stylish shoes (the XT-6 in particular) were the first trekking trainers to become popular among the fashion elite (including being worn by Rihanna) â€“ but it looks like La Sportiva could be set to take over.<b>Â </b>Â â€œThis kind of functional shoe shape is so popular right now, especially with the â€˜Gorpcoreâ€™ trend being key,â€ explains sneakerhead Kai Kho. â€œSalomon has managed to build such a reputation within the industry, but itâ€™s only a matter of time before Sportiva are also worn by celebrities and stocked at big retailers, just like Salomon.â€Â </p>

<h3>Loewe + ON Cloudtilt<br />
	  </h3>
<p>Aptly-named the Cloudtilt, thanks to the springy extra-comfy sole, Loeweâ€™s collaboration with Swiss running trainer brand ON is set to be one of the key styles of 2024. Net-a-Porter has reported that both brands are among the most popular on the site at the moment, with a 75% rise in searches for Loewe in the last six months and a huge 200% jump for ON in the last year. So when you combine the two most sought-after labels, you are certain get the coolest designer trainer around. Launched right at the end of last year, we predict the sorbet shades will be the ones everyoneâ€™s wearing with their spring/summer 2024 outfits.Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Bad Sisters </i>was originally intended as a one-off.Â </p>
<p>The pitch-black comedy on Apple TV+ about the Garvey sistersÂ â€“ and the murder of one of their<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/bad-sisters-apple-tv-john-paul-williams-villain-narrative/707098" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> awful husbands</a>Â â€“Â was one of our favourite shows of 2022, and also scored a very rare 100% fresh review on Rotten Tomatoes (meaning the critics approved), as well as acrruing a raft of Bafta TV nominations. </p>
</p>
<p>Thankfully <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/sharon-horgan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharon Horgan</a>, the showâ€™s creator and one of its stars, has seen the light and fans will get to revisit the murderous siblings. She has told <i><a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/comedy/sharon-horgan-bad-sisters-season-2-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Radio Times</a></i>: â€œI had no intention of doing any more, but while we were on set I kept thinking of this one idea that could be a possible second season. The first series did have a lovely end, but I think when you kill a man, when you put yourself through that â€“ and there were five of them in it â€“ life is going to change. You donâ€™t just dust yourself off and get on with your life. I was interested in what would happen to these women next. And weâ€™ll find out.â€</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s what we know about the show so far.Â </p></p>

<h3>What is <i>Bad Sisters </i>season two about?</h3>
<p>Based on a Belgian series called <i>Clan</i>, the chaotically brilliant 10-part series begins at the funeral ofÂ  John Paul (Claes Bang) - and his rigor mortis-induced erection. The casket is surrounded by his wife Grace (Anne-Marie Duff) and her four sisters, and we quickly learn that all of them hated himÂ â€“ rightfully so, as he was manipulative and abusive to his wifeÂ â€“ and that his death wasnâ€™t an accident.Â </p>
<p>Via a series of flashbacks, the series follows the sistersâ€™ attempts to save Grace from her marital nightmare and take down â€˜The Prickâ€™. But things go awry when two insurance brokers come to investigate the claim, determined to prove he was murdered, to prevent having to make a huge payout.  </p>
</p>
<p>While we donâ€™t know much about where the plot of the new season will take them, Horgan has given a strong hint that it wonâ€™t be plain sailing. â€œI mean, let this be a lesson to you â€” you donâ€™t usually just kill a man and get away with it.â€</p>

<h3>Who stars in <i>Bad Sisters </i>season two?</h3>
<p>The cast for series two is yet to be confirmed, but weâ€™re hopeful the whole Garvey clan will be back. That includes Sharon Horgan as Eva Garvey, Anne-Marie Duff as Grace Williams, Sarah Greene as Bibi Garvey, Eva Birthistle as Ursula Flynn and Eve Hewson as Becka Garvey. Weâ€™re also hopeful for the return of Daryl McCormack as Matthew Claffin, who was entangled romantically with Becka, and his brother and fellow insurance broker Thomas (played byÂ Brian Gleeson).</p></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to quick, easy and healthy breakfasts, smoothies often come out on top. Bung a scoop of protein in for a recovery shake, add a spoon of flax or husk for added fibre or top with yoghurt and cacao nibs for a probiotic hit. For years, smoothies were often favoured over juices, because a smoothie often involves the blitzing of whole fruit and veg â€“ keeping in all that gut-loving fibre â€“ while juices tend to strip away most of the bulk, leaving behind a sugary (but delicious) liquid. </p>
<p>But, perhaps predictably in an age of blood sugar panic, smoothies are now in the firing line. Dr Idress Mughal (AKA <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dr_idz/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Idz</a>) recently shared a video by a wellness podcaster who claimed that blending fruits â€œquadruples the glycemic profileâ€. This influencer went on to explain when you blitz a fruit, you disperse the fibre, which he argued leads to a four-time elevation in blood sugar compared with eating a whole fruit. Thatâ€™s a worry, he said, because â€œblood sugar is the root of all evilâ€.Â </p>
<p>Now, leaving aside the hyperbole of that last statement, this all sounds quite worrying. Even if you arenâ€™t fully subscribed to the glucose fear doing the rounds at the moment, no one wants to see a huge surge at breakfastÂ â€“ especially if you canâ€™t afford to take an 11am crash break.Â </p>
<p>So, whatâ€™s the truth? Are smoothies still a good way to start the day or are we better off eating whole fruits and nuts? </p>
<div class="iframely-instagram iframely-app iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="Dr Idrees Mughal (MBBS, MRes, DipIBLM) on Instagram: &quot;@garybrecka â—ï¸BLENDING FRUIT INCREASES BLOOD SUGAR 4X MORE!! ðŸ˜±ðŸðŸŒâŒ #weightloss #fatloss #nutrition #fitness #health #gym #doctor&quot;" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/gOWzBBP?maxheight=1200&app=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Dr Idz cleared up the claims by pointing to a controlled trial which compared the blood sugar effect of eating whole and blended apples and blackberries. It found that blended fruits actually resulted in a 15% lower blood sugar spike, with the research suggesting that the reduction was down to that fibre being dispersed around the drink.Â Â 
	  </p>
<p>Thatâ€™s seconded by Sophie Medlin,Â director and specialist dietitian at <a href="https://www.citydietitians.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CityDietitians</a>.Â â€œFirstly, there is evidence that smoothies cause less of an increase in blood sugars than whole fruit does,â€ she says. â€œThis is thought to be because the fibre is dispersed amongst the fructose from the fruit, allowing us to process it more slowly. Adding protein will further dampen any increase in blood sugars.Â </p>
<p>â€œSecondly, we donâ€™t need to worry about normal fluctuations in blood glucose from things like fruits or smoothies because people who are free from diabetes are perfectly capable of managing this without any harm being caused.â€ </p>

<h4>Smoothies cause less of a glucose spike than whole fruit</h4>

<p>In other words, for the majority of us, this whole hoo-hah over <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/glucose-blood-sugar-spikes-bad/865344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glucose spikes</a>Â is just noise. â€œ[Spikes] are a completely normal function of the human body and not a concern for most people,â€ says Rohini Bajekal, nutritionist and co-author or <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/living-pcos-free-how-to-regain-your-hormonal-health-with-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-nitu-bajekal/6425928?ean=9781781612132&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwh4-wBhB3EiwAeJsppOxUXqvP9mDxgUhbcd-E7pRNV_f9QZsSeuQprQcCGVavMLPBcn1PTxoCwjkQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living PCOS Free</a>.Â </p>
<p>â€œAfter we consume carbohydrates (like fruits and veg), they are broken down into sugars that enter the bloodstream to deliver energy to the muscles.â€ She says that a smoothie containing only fruit will have more of an impact on blood sugar than a smoothie with additional fats and protein, but a â€œâ€™spikeâ€™ in itself is not something to worry about and there is no solid evidence that these normal fluctuations are harmful in people without diabetes.</p>
<p>As such, she says that smoothies are â€œabsolutelyâ€ a healthy meal or snack. But she also says that smoothies should be more than just blended fruit, veg and water. â€œThey an be a great vehicle for nutrients such as healthy fatsÂ â€“ including plant milks, avocado, soya yogurt, ground flaxseed, chia seeds, nuts, nut butter or tahiniÂ â€“ which make smoothies more satiating. These ingredients also boost the protein content â€“ you could even use silken tofu or a vegan protein powder.</p>
<p>â€œDrizzle nut butter on top and add some granola for crunch or fresh fruit and seeds. You can also add in fresh herbs such as mint for a refreshing taste, or cinnamon.â€ </p>
<p>Bajekal also says theyâ€™re great for anyone struggling to eat enough â€“ those who are nauseous post-workout of during pregnancy, for example. â€œWhen you blend ingredients, you break down plant cell walls, which makes many nutrients even more digestible. They are also an excellent way to add some greens into the diet. You can hardly taste the kale in a banana, soya milk, kale, cacao and peanut butter smoothie.â€Â </p>

<h2>Are whole fruits better than smoothies?</h2><p>Are there any benefits to eating fruits whole rather than blitzing them? â€œEating or blending fruits makes very little difference to me as a dietitian,â€ says Medlin. â€œAs long as people are eating plenty of plants, theyâ€™ll be fine. That said, blending fruits and vegetables will mean you get less insoluble fibre â€“ the type of fibre that comes from skins, peels and pips â€“ from them, so this may reduce the bulk of your stools, making it harder for your bowel to move them along the gut.â€ But she also says that smoothies contain plenty of soluable fibre, so your gut bacteria will still have plenty to feed on.</p>
<p>The only people who <i>might</i>Â be better off plumping for whole foods over smoothies most of the time are people who struggle with blood sugar control, like women with PCOS or pre-diabetes.</p>
</p>
<p>For the most part, â€œissues with high blood sugar are only a concern for diabetics who maintain high blood sugar levels over a period of years â€“ after which it starts to damage their bodies,â€ says PT and dietitian Adam Enaz. â€œWith the new hype of everyone glucose monitoring, a fear has built around having raised glucose levels after eating.â€</p>
<p>In a rare form of humility, the influencer called out by Dr Idz actually took his feedback on board and wrote in the video comments that heâ€™d been wrong in his conclusions.Â </p>
<h2>3 ways to make your smoothie more nutritious</h2><p>Enaz offers three tips for making the most nutritious smoothie:</p>
<h3>Keep it to two fruits </h3>
<p>Along with milk, he recommends using two fruits and more veg. If you are concerned about sugar, then make one of those fruits a berry, as these tend to be slightly less sweet and are packed with antioxidants and other micronutrients. Just be aware that blending bananas and berries can corrupt the nutrients of berries, so you might be better off keeping the two apart. </p>
<h3>Add fibre </h3>
<p>By adding extra fibre, youâ€™re going to slow down the energy production, meaning the smoothie will leave you fuller for longer. </p>
<h3>Load up on protein </h3>
<p>â€œAdd in a source of protein like Greek yoghurt or plant-based protein powder to balance the macronutrients,â€ says Enaz.Â </p>

<h2>Refreshing green smoothie recipe</h2><p>Bajekal offers the following tip for her go-to breakfast smoothie: â€œFreeze a medium sized ripe banana in advance and chop it into thirds to make it easier for your blender. I usually dice several bananas at once, separate them on a plate and pop the plate in my freezer for an hour or so. Then I remove the plate and add all the diced bananas to a ziplock silicone bag and freeze. This prevents the banana pieces sticking together, which is what usually happens if you dice and freeze them immediately in the bag.â€</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
</p>
<p>Â½ cup unsweetened soya, pea or oat milk </p>
<p>1 medium-sized frozen banana  </p>
<p>1 cup frozen mango  </p>
<p>80g cucumber (1 small or Â½ medium)  </p>
<p>20g (around a thumb-sized/2-inch piece) of fresh ginger </p>
<p>1 sprig of fresh mint, including the leaves </p>
<p>1 tbsp hemp seeds</p>
<h3>MethodÂ </h3>
<p>Blend for a minute until smooth and enjoy immediately. Top with a sprig of mint and hemp seeds.Â Â </p>
<p>â€œIf you donâ€™t have frozen mango, you can use 1 cup frozen pineapple or Â½ a medium fresh mango. A cup of frozen blueberries works, although the colour wonâ€™t be pretty! If you dislike the taste of banana in smoothies, try 1 frozen courgette instead, and add a date for sweetness. Add a soft date (e.g. Medjool date) or two to the smoothie for a sweeter flavour.â€</p></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you enjoy curling up tight in a ball, lying flat on your back or collapsing face down in a starfish position, everyone has their own favourite <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/best-sleeping-positions-back-ache/632279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sleeping position</a>. Itâ€™s probably not something you think of that often; in most cases, itâ€™s simply what feels most comfy.  </p>
<p>But the position that feels good when you first climb in between the sheets may not be best for you in the long run. In fact, adopting the wrong sleep position can not only exacerbate pre-existing back pain, but also create new issues. So, while contorting your body in a certain way might <i>feel</i> natural, it could also be the reason you wake up in agony.  </p>
<p>Of course, you canâ€™t always control what happens while youâ€™re asleep, as anyone whoâ€™s woken up with a sock flung halfway across the room and the legs of their pyjamas hoisted up above their knees will know. What you can do, however, is go to sleep in a position which will best support your back as youâ€™re nodding off â€“ and thatâ€™s where this guide comes in.Â </p>
<p>â€œThere isnâ€™t one â€˜rightâ€™ sleeping position that will guarantee everyone a restful and pain-free sleep â€“ everyone experiences pain differently and what works for one person may not work for another,â€ explains Karen Beattie, a leading musculoskeletal expert and corporate clinical lead at <a href="https://www.vitahealthgroup.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vita Health Group</a>. â€œHowever, there are some simple tricks you can try thatâ€™ll help to take the pain and strain off your back and give you a restorative nightâ€™s sleep.â€ </p>
<p>Below, Beattie talks us through the best sleeping positions to relieve back pain for back, side and stomach sleepers, as well as some easy tricks you can use to reduce pain before you get into bed.Â </p>
<h2>The best sleeping positions for relieving back painÂ Â </h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Woman in bed with white sheets" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/06/07103617/gettyimages-1162988392-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>For side sleepers: </h3>
<p>Side sleepers with lower back or neck pain will benefit from using pillow supports, Beattie says. </p>
<p>â€œTry drawing your legs up slightly towards your chest and putting a pillow between your legs,â€ she explains. â€œThis can help to align your spine, pelvis and hips.â€ </p>
<p>The pillow between your legs can also prevent your upper leg from falling forward, which can cause your torso to twist and increase tension across your back. </p>
<p>â€œAvoid tucking your chin to maintain the natural curve of your neck,â€ Beattie adds.</p>
<h3>For back sleepers: </h3>
<p>Back sleepers can also benefit from using a pillow to support their alignment. </p>
<p>â€œPlacing a pillow under your knees can help to relax your back muscles and maintain the curve of your lower back,â€ Beattie explains. â€œTo hold your body in place, you could also try putting a small, rolled-up towel under the small of your back.â€ </p>
<h3>For front sleepers: </h3>
<p>Itâ€™s worth noting that sleeping on your front isnâ€™t ideal for your musculoskeletal health because of the extra strain it places on your neck and lower back.  </p>
<p>But if sleeping on your front is the only way that feels right, you can also use a pillow to relieve some of the tension, Beattie adds.  </p>
<p>â€œPlacing a pillow under your hips and lower stomach can take the pressure off your lower back,â€ she says. â€œYou may also want to try having a pillow under your head [if you sleep without one] if your neck feels strained.â€Â </p>
<h2>How to enjoy a comfortable, pain-free sleepÂ </h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="A woman stretching at home" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2024/02/22121425/woman-stretching-movement-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While your sleeping position will make a big difference to how your body feels while youâ€™re in bed and when you wake up in the morning, there are some things you can do to relieve tension and prevent pain from arising before you even get into bed in the evening.  </p>
<h3>1. Do some light movement </h3>
<p>â€œIf you take just a few minutes to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/sleep-heat-stretch-routine/417847" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stretch and move your body before you go to bed</a>, it can help to ease muscle tension thatâ€™s built up during the day,â€ Beattie says. â€œStretching and light exercise can also help to reduce stress before going to sleep.â€ </p>
<p>The key word here is light: anything too heavy that elevates your heart rate could <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/research-exercise-before-sleep-problems/573299#:~:text=Along%20with%20difficulty%20falling%20asleep,workouts%2C%20which%20caused%20sleep%20disturbance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make it harder for you to fall asleep</a>, so make sure to take things nice and slow.Â </p>
<h3>2. Get the temperature right </h3>
<p>During <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/deep-sleep-how-much-do-you-need-get-more/389411" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deep, restorative sleep</a> your muscles do not move, so maximising the amount of time you spend in this state will allow you to maintain your sleeping position and prevent too much tossing and turning, which can put strain on your muscles and joints.Â </p>
<p>Ensuring your bedroom is the right temperature for a restful nightâ€™s sleep is a good place to start, Beattie suggests. â€œHaving a bedroom thatâ€™s hot and stuffy, or too cool, could cause you to have a restless nightâ€™s sleep. Think about the tog rating of your duvet: a lighter one is best in summer and a heavier one is best to support sleep in winter. Focus on creating an environment thatâ€™s comfortable for you and gives your body the opportunity to have a restful night sleep.â€</p>
<p><a href="https://staging.stylist.co.uk/health/sleep/how-to-get-to-sleep-fast-warm-bath-before-bed-natural-remedy-sleep-aid/344204" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Having a hot bath before bed</a> can also help your body to feel cooler once youâ€™re in bed, as the hot water will cause your bodyâ€™s cooling response to kick in. This cooling effect can also make it easier for you to fall asleep, as the drop in temperature stimulates the release of the sleep hormone, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/sleep/what-is-melatonin/704668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">melatonin</a>.  </p>
<h3>3. See an expert </h3>
<p>If youâ€™re struggling with persistent back pain, itâ€™s time to seek professional help. </p>
<p>â€œReassuringly, most episodes of back pain will resolve naturally over time,â€ Beattie says. â€œBut for those stubborn episodes that donâ€™t resolve as quickly as you would have hoped, musculoskeletal experts â€“ such as physiotherapists, musculoskeletal clinicians and rehabilitation specialists â€“ can support you with your recovery by providing tailored programmes consisting of advice, coaching, and tailored exercise programmes, with your goals at the core.â€ </p>
<p>A GP appointment is a good place to start, as they should be able to refer you to any specialists or recommend additional treatments.Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inflammation may sound scary, but itâ€™s very useful. Not only does it help to heal wounds and fight off infection, but itâ€™s also a natural byproduct of our womb lining shedding during menstruation. As with anything, however, you can have too much of a good thing. <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/women/endometriosis-autoimmune-link/865763" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autoimmune diseases such as endometriosis</a>, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, cystic fibrosis and Crohnâ€™s disease have all been linked to an abnormal inflammatory response and research suggests chronic inflammation could play a role in conditions ranging from cancer to stroke.Â </p>
<p>Women tend to experience higher levels of inflammation than men, putting us more at risk of those unwanted consequences. But why is this? And is there a solution?Â Â </p>
<h2>What is inflammation?</h2><p>When you get a papercut, it may become red, swollen, warm and painful. These symptoms occur for several reasons, but mainly because blood and immune system cells are quickly pumped to the site of injury. They are all signs of inflammation â€“ a process that forms part of the bodyâ€™s defense system.  </p>
<p>Inflammation happens all over the body (internally and externally) as a result of injuries, but also germs (bacteria, viruses or fungus). Bronchitis, for example, is a common internal inflammatory condition in the airways and lungs, usually triggered in response to a virus (eg the common cold, flu or Covid). The symptoms can include a cough, a fever, tiredness and a runny nose. These are all signs of inflammation, which might temporarily make you feel rough but are a vital defensive tool.</p>
<p>The fever, for example, helps to create an unfriendly atmosphere for the pathogens to thrive. Inflammation in the bronchial tubes can also lead to an increased production of mucus, which helps to provide a protective barrier against harmful foreign particles and lubricates to prevent injury. Coughing then expels the mucus, which carries the infection, preventing it from accumulating in the airways and causing a more severe reaction.  </p>
<p>The inflammatory process is smart but also tiring. You feel exhausted when you have acute inflammation because your body is doing a lot to try to protect you. </p>
<p>But this kind of inflammatory response is typically short term, so most people can deal with it. Itâ€™s when inflammation hangs around and becomes chronic that things become problematic â€“ and itâ€™s women who are more likely to be affected.Â </p>
<h2>The link between inflammation and sex (and what it means)Â </h2><p>Research has shown that adult women have stronger innate and adaptive immune responses than men, which is a good thing when weâ€™re fighting off dangerous infections. But it also means weâ€™re at increased risk of autoimmune conditions, which occur when the immune system malfunctions or goes into overdrive, attacking healthy cells. </p>
<p>Statistics show that up to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=19356902&dopt=Abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">80% of people</a> with autoimmune diseases are women, and many of these inflammatory conditions are chronic. While acute episodes of inflammation are mainly positive, chronic inflammation can be problematic. â€œItâ€™s like a fire erupting in a village. Everyone pours water on the fire, and it goes out without any lasting damage,â€ explains Natasha Seaton, a researcher in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from Kingâ€™s College London. â€œBut if the villagers continue to pour water on a fire that no longer exists, youâ€™d get damaging flooding throughout the town.â€Â </p>

<p></p>

<p>Symptoms of chronic inflammation present differently for everyone. Someone living with chronic cystitis might experience bladder pain and urgency, while an IBD patient could struggle with severe abdominal pain or <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/iron-deficiency-signs-symptoms-food/395556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anaemia</a>. Tests like stool samples, blood tests, ultrasounds and biopsies are used as diagnostic tools to reveal autoimmune conditions and excess inflammation. But despite a general understanding of the issue, the cause is less understood. </p>
<p>As with most areas of womenâ€™s health, the reasons and impacts are not yet fully understood. While hormonal factors are likely important â€“ particularly the role of oestrogen in modulating inflammation â€“ research now points to chromosomal differences as a big component, with the genes in the extra X chromosome women possess directly relating to the immune response.Â </p>
<h2>Is poor mental health caused by inflammation?</h2><p>According to the <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mental Health Foundation</a>, women are three times more likely than men to experience common mental health problems such asÂ <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/how-to-deal-with-anxiety/751165" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anxiety</a> and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/depression-serotonin-link/685970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">depression</a>. That disparity can be linked to several factors, such as gendered pressures and excess stress levels, but it may also be linked to all the inflammation women are dealing with.  </p>
<p>Professor Valeria Mondelli, clinical professor of psychoneuroimmunology at Kingâ€™s College London, tells Strong Women that an â€œincrease in inflammation can lead to mental health problems, and up to 30% of people living with depression also have an inflammatory disorderâ€.</p>
<p>Edward Bullmore explores this further in his book <i><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Inflamed-Mind-radical-approach-depression/dp/1780723725/ref=sr_1_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Inflamed Mind</a></i>, in which he refutes the belief that inflammation canâ€™t travel into the brain. He suggests that his patients with rheumatoid arthritis are not simply depressed because of the limiting factors of their disability, but because the inflammation associated with the condition itself was reaching the brain and causing depression.Â </p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Woman with poor mental health" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2024/03/12115808/gettyimages-1353629776-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All of this raises the question: are women more at risk of depression and/or anxiety than men if weâ€™re more likely to be chronically inflamed? Professor Mondelli tells us that while more research in this field is still needed, thereâ€™s some evidence to suggest that the answer may be â€˜yesâ€™.</p>
<p>The â€˜chicken and eggâ€™ conundrum here makes separating cause and consequence very difficult. What came first â€“ the lupus or the trauma? The psychosis or the polymyalgia?â€¯Is the number of women suffering with mental health issues the result of inflammation or are the mental health issues causing the inflammation in the first place?Â </p>
<p>As someone who lives with chronic health conditions, Iâ€™ve always found the whole â€˜mind-body connectionâ€™ an extremely hard pill to swallow. If my physical symptoms and conditions â€“ which include asthma, chronic fatigue, migraines, chronic cystitis and so on â€“ are linked to my mind, am I in some way responsible for them?</p>
<p>Seaton explains that itâ€™s not that simple. The mind-body connection doesnâ€™t mean people are thinking the problems into existence; rather, itâ€™s a term used to describe a physiological response.  </p>
<p>â€œAutoimmune conditions have been shown to arise following stressful periods,â€ she explains. Indeed, stress can cause the sympathetic nervous system to become dysregulated and create a â€˜biochemical cascadeâ€™ that can result in various symptoms.Â </p>
<section class="pp-article__boxout">

<div class="pp-boxout__body">
<h4>You canâ€™t think health problems into existence</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>This link between stress and inflammation could also explain why more women struggle with high levels of both. After all, being a sick or disabled woman â€“ as with any minoritised group â€“ can come with high levels of distress.Â </p>
<p>The gender health gap has left many women unfairly treated. Women in the UK are <a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2016/august/women-are-50-per-cent-more-likely-than-men-to-be-given-incorrect-diagnosis-following-a-heart-attack#:~:text=Women%20have%20a%2050%20per,new%20study%20we%20part%2Dfunded." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">50% more likely to be misdiagnosed following a heart attack</a> (which can be caused by inflammation) and women with dementia (the risk of which can be exacerbated by inflammation) <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2016/dec/women-dementia-receive-less-medical-attention" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tend to receive worse medical treatment than men</a>. Weâ€™re also up to four timesÂ more likely to suffer from an autoimmune disease (which, as we already know, has been linked to that inflammation response).Â </p>
<p>So, is oppression making us sick? Certainly, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35029597/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent findings</a> highlight the need to â€˜tackle discriminationâ€™ to improve the wellbeing of pain sufferers and potentially â€˜reduce the risk of pain onsetâ€™.Â Â </p>
<p>Sarah Lees, 28, lives with <a href="https://staging.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/how-to-exercise-with-arthritis-pilates/686061" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rheumatoid arthritis (RA)</a>, which causes swelling and pain in her joints and extreme fatigue. She believes that long-term medical stress is inextricably linked to her inflammatory condition, claiming that institutional sexism stopped her from accessing necessary medication.  </p>
<p>â€œThe patriarchal structure of the medical system meant that I wasnâ€™t able to access the medication that I needed for a long time,â€ she says. Lee claims that her needs were ignored because she was seen as â€œtoo emotionalâ€ during medical appointments. It wasnâ€™t until her dadâ€™s friend told her about Biologics (an injectable drug that has transformed her life) and encouraged her to â€œpush for the treatment no matter whatâ€ that she was able to make some progress with her recovery.</p>
<h2>How to deal with chronic inflammation</h2><p>Change wonâ€™t happen overnight, but a growing understanding of the link between inflammation and mental health could improve things. After all, for mind-body obstacles, we need mind-body solutions, as Professor Mondelli highlights.Â 
	  </p>
<p>â€œWe have found that for patients who have both inflammation and depression, we can regulate their depression by using anti-inflammatory medication,â€ she says.  </p>
<p>Seaton has similarly found that treatments for mental illness can lead to significant improvement in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Her research explores what happens to an IBD patientâ€™s inflammation if you treat their anxiety, depression and distress, and has found that psychological therapy including <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/what-is-cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-mental-health-treatment-anxiety/363488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</a> can cause the largest reductions of inflammation in IBD. This is likely because of the link between mental health and physical inflammation, but it may also be linked to the fact that people with better mental health are more easily able to look after their physical health â€“ including taking medication on time and exercising.</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Black hands with medication" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2024/03/12120024/gettyimages-1391441819-1-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are a number of lifestyle and wellness interventions that have been found to reduce inflammation, from infrared saunas to cold water. Iâ€™ve certainly found the latter helps massively in reducing the severity of my symptoms.</p>
<p>But as Iâ€™m reaching for my next bottle of salted caramel kefir in the supermarket (jam-packed with sugar which is, you guessed it, inflammatory), I canâ€™t help but wonder if the diet and wellness industryâ€™s use of the term â€˜<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/recipes/anti-inflammatory-foods-diet/435956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-inflammatory</a>â€™ is just another marketing scheme targeted at women who are more informed than ever about the damaging effects of inflammation but less aware of the reasons why they have it.Â </p>
<p>While more research is needed, findings that reinforce the link between mental health and physical inflammation are promising. Letâ€™s hope more research into the issue â€“ and growing awareness of the gender health gap and the impact it has on women who are struggling â€“ could provide a way forward.Â

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With thousands upon thousands of books published each year, it can be overwhelming to find the ones truly worth reading. But the Womenâ€™s Prize is a great place to start, a community that brings people together through their shared love of books written by women.</p>
<p>And while their Womenâ€™s Prize for Fiction awards have been running since 1996, this is their inaugural year for a non-fiction alternative. Judges include historian and broadcaster Professor Suzannah Lipscomb, fashion campaigner Venetia La Manna, academic and author Professor Nicola Rollock, biographer and journalist Anne Sebba and author and Womenâ€™s Prize for Fiction 2018 winner Kamila Shamsie.</p>
<p> The shortlist has now been revealed for the Womenâ€™s Prize for Non-Fiction 2024, showcasing six incredible books exploring everything from a turbulent life in rural Jamaica to how AI is taking over the world.Â </p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">Thunderclap: A Memoir of Art and Life And Sudden Death by Laura Cumming</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>On the morning of 12 October 1654, a gunpowder explosion in Delft left the Dutch city devastated. Among the victims was Carel Fabritius, 32, a painter who left behind his haunting masterpiece â€˜The Goldfinchâ€™, among a few other pieces of artwork. </p>
<p>Cummingâ€™s book explores Fabritiusâ€™s life before the disaster and the connection between art and life, interweaving her own life and the death of her Scottish painter father into the story, along with appearances from the great artists of the Dutch Golden Age. </p>
<p>â€œI love this book because of the way she intertwines a subtle and tender love of her father with a deep understanding of Dutch art,â€ says judge Anne Sebba.</p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">DOPPELGANGER: A Trip Into The Mirror World by Naomi Klein</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>What if you woke up one morning and found youâ€™d acquired a double? </p>
<p>Klein discovered that a woman who shared her first name, but had radically different, harmful views to her, was being mistaken for her. At first it was too ridiculous to take seriously. But then it took a dark turn, as she began grappling with a distorted sense of reality, becoming obsessed with reading threats and insults on social media from the followers of her doppelganger. </p>
<p>Klein decided to follow her double into a bizarre, uncanny mirror world of conspiracy theories and anti-vaxxers â€“ lifting the lid on our own culture, from public shaming to deep fakes. </p>
<p>â€œSuch a clever book, because [Klein] takes what, on the face of it, is a simple idea of having a double, someone who is frequently thought of as her, but then expands this to construct a dark comedy of a rather terrifying mirror image world,â€ writes Sebba.</p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">A FLAT PLACE: A Memoir by Noreen Masud</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>Masud has always loved flatlands since her early memories of wide, flat fields spanning the horizons as she drove in the back seat of her fatherâ€™s car in Lahore. As an adult in Britain, she has discovered many more â€“ Orford Ness, the Cambridgeshire Fens and Morecambe Bay, to name a few. </p>
<p>However, these bare, haunted expanses remind her of the flat place within her, created by trauma. Suffering from complex PTSD, Masud embarks on a pilgrimage to Britainâ€™s flatlands to seek solace and belonging, weaving in poetry, folklore and history, with recollections of her own early life. </p>
<p>â€œI love this for its originality and its intelligence. It is revelatory about both people and places,â€ says judge Kamila Shamsie.</p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">ALL THAT SHE CARRIED: The Journey of Ashleyâ€™s Sack, a Black Family Keepsake by Tiya Miles</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>In 1850s South Carolina, Rose, an enslaved woman, faced a crisis: the imminent sale of her daughter Ashley. Thinking quickly, she packed a cotton bag with a few items. Soon after, the nine-year-old girl was separated from her mother and sold. Decades later, Ashleyâ€™s granddaughter Ruth embroidered this family history on the sack in spare, haunting language. </p>
<p>How does one uncover the lives of people who, in their day, were considered property? Harvard historian Tiya Miles carefully traces these womenâ€™s faint presence in archival records and, where archives fall short, she turns to objects, art and the environment to write a singular history of the experience of slavery, and the uncertain freedom afterward. </p>
<p>â€œA vital re-telling and re-imagining of stories lost under enslavement. A bold and beautiful book, I loved it,â€ says judge Venetia La Manna.</p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">CODE DEPENDENT: Living in the Shadow of AI by Madhumita Murgia</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>What does it mean to be a human in a world of artificial intelligence? Through the voices of ordinary people, this book explores the impact of a set of powerful, flawed and often exploitative technologies on individuals, communities and our wider society. </p>
<p>How can AI strip away our collective and individual sense of agency? How will we be governed by algorithms in years to come? Why are we relinquishing our moral authority to machines? Murgia, the <i>Financial Times</i>â€™ first Artificial Intelligence Editor, not only sheds light on this chilling phenomenon, but also charts a path of resistance. </p>
<p>â€œThis is a chilling and essential read about AI and the way it imports and exacerbates existing social inequalities,â€ says judge Professor Nicola Rollock.</p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">HOW TO SAY BABYLON: A Jamaican Memoir by Safiya Sinclair</h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>Born in Montego Bay, Jamaica, where luxury hotels line pristine white sand beaches, Sinclair grew up with a volatile reggae musician father who was a strict believer in a militant sect of Rastafari. To protect the purity of the women in their family, he forbade almost everything: nowhere but home and school, no friends but this family and no future but this path.</p>
<p>Her mother did what she could to bring joy to her children with books and poetry. But as Safiyaâ€™s imagination reached beyond its restrictive borders, her burgeoning independence brought with it ever greater clashes with her father. Soon she realised that if she was to live at all, she had to find some way to leave home. In seeking to understand the past of her family, Sinclair takes readers inside a world that is little understood by those outside it, and offers an astonishing personal reckoning. An unforgettable story of a young womanâ€™s determination to live life on her own terms.</p>
<p>â€œA lyrical, evocative, and beautifully written memoir about growing up Rastafari in rural Jamaica,â€ says Rollock.Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you love woman-led psychological <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/tv/best-thriller-series-2024/856607" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thrillers</a>Â then we have some excellent news for you: Apple TV+ has announced itâ€™s working on a new limited series, <i>Imperfect Women</i>, where a crime shatters the lives and decades-long friendships of three women.</p>
<p>Based on Araminta Hallâ€™s novel, <i>Imperfect Women</i> is packed with suspense and drama and explores guilt and retribution, love and betrayal and the decisions we make that ultimately alter our lives forever. Mysterious, right? Well, hereâ€™s everything we know so far about the series.</p>
<h2><b>What is the plot of <i>Imperfect Women</i>?</b></h2>
<p>As the series is an adaptation of the book, we can only assume that itâ€™ll follow a similar story. Nancy Hennessy is murdered, leaving behind her two best friends (Eleanor and Mary), her husband and daughter, and a secret lover whose identity she never revealed to anyone. From the outside, Nancyâ€™s life was perfect. But, â€œas the investigation unravels, so does the truth about how even the closest relationships can change over timeâ€, warns the synopsis. </p>
<p><i>Imperfect Women</i> poses the question: how well do we really know our friends, or even ourselves?</p>
<h2><b>Who will star in <i>Imperfect Women</i>?</b></h2>
<p>As the project has only just been announced, not much is known about the casting apart from Elisabeth Moss and Kerry Washington being on board. Itâ€™s likely that the pair will play the two friends, Eleanor and Mary, but thatâ€™s just speculation at this point.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/kerry-washintgon-elisabeth-moss-imperfect-women-series-apple-1235952370/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking about the series</a>, Moss said: â€œFrom the moment I received Aramintaâ€™s novel, I couldnâ€™t put it downâ€¦ I fell in love with it immediately. Iâ€™ve admired Kerry and her work as an actor and producer for many years, and have been looking for something to work with her on, and was so thrilled that she responded to the material when we sent it to her.â€</p>
<h2><b>When will <i>Imperfect Women</i> be released?</b></h2>
<p>As the series is in production, itâ€™ll be a long while until we get a release date for <i>Imperfect Women</i>. Weâ€™ll be sure to update you with any new details as theyâ€™re announced.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Itâ€™s a good time to be a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/beyonce-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BeyoncÃ©</a>Â fan. Last month, during the 58th Super Bowl, Queen Bey announced that the second album in her <i>Renaissance</i> trilogy will be released on 29 March. </p>
<p>Using her appearance in a Verizon advert that ran shortly after halftime during the game, she joked with the comedian Tony Hale about doing something that would â€œbreak the internetâ€. Then, just before the commercial ended, she said: â€œDrop the new music.â€ Soon after, BeyoncÃ©â€™s website was updated with the news that a new album was on its way.Â </p>
<div class="iframely-instagram iframely-app iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="BeyonceÌ on Instagram" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/7xja1x9?maxheight=1200&app=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Just days after <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/beyonce-new-hair-care-brand-cecred/862385" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unveiling her hair care brand CÃ©cred</a>, the singer also dropped two brand new singles, <i>Texas HoldÂ </i>â€™<i>Em</i> and <i>16 Carriages</i>, confirming that the follow-up album to 2022â€™s <i>Renaissance</i> will be country-themed. Accompanying artwork was then released for the two new singles, with both featuring BeyoncÃ© wearing a cowboy hat, matching the one she wore to the Grammys last week.</p>
<p><i>Texas Hold â€˜Em</i> then went on to make history for the singer, making BeyoncÃ© the first Black woman ever to top Billboardâ€™s Hot Country Songs chart, as well as reaching the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 and has held number one on the Official UK Singles Chart for three consecutive weeks now.</p>
<div class="iframely-instagram iframely-app iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="BeyonceÌ on Instagram" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/huhk7fT?maxheight=1200&app=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Then earlier this month she quietly announced the name of her new album via Instagram stories, with a link to pre-order: <i>Cowboy Carter</i>.</p>
<p>Posting a picture of horseâ€™s saddle adorned with a red white and blue sash emblazoned with the words â€˜Cowboy Carterâ€™ the link leads to BeyoncÃ©â€™s official merch shop which includes limited edition T-shirts and vinyl covers.Â </p>
<p>And now sheâ€™s finally revealed a track list for the upcoming album, and a hotly anticipated cover of Jolene features, alongside queen Dolly Parton.Â </p>
<p>Posting a vintage-style poster to her Instagram page, the track list features 26 songs:</p>
<p>1.	â€œAmerican Requiemâ€	 </p>
<p>2.	â€œBlackbirdâ€	 </p>
<p>3.	â€œ16 Carriagesâ€	 </p>
<p>4.	â€œProtectorâ€	 </p>
<p>5.	â€œMy Roseâ€	 </p>
<p>6.	â€œSmoke Hourâ€ (featuring Willie Nelson)	 </p>
<p>7.	â€œTexas Hold â€˜Emâ€	 </p>
<p>8.	â€œBodyguardâ€	 </p>
<p>9.	â€œJoleneâ€ (featuring Dolly Parton)	 </p>
<p>10.	â€œDaughterâ€	 </p>
<p>11.	â€œSpaghettiiâ€	 </p>
<p>12.	â€œAlligator Tearsâ€	 </p>
<p>13.	â€œSmoke Hour IIâ€	 </p>
<p>14.	â€œJust for Funâ€	 </p>
<p>15.	â€œII Most Wantedâ€	 </p>

<p>19.	â€œYa Yaâ€	 </p>
<p>20.	â€œOh Louisianaâ€	 </p>
<p>21.	â€œDesert Eagleâ€	 </p>
<p>22.	â€œRiverdanceâ€	 </p>
<p>23.	â€œII Hands II Heavenâ€	 </p>
<p>24.	â€œTyrantâ€	 </p>
<p>25.	â€œSweet Honey Buckinâ€™â€	 </p>
<p>26.	â€œAmenâ€</p>
<p>Last year, BeyoncÃ©â€™s <i>Renaissance</i> tour grossed over $579 million (Â£459m) and was followed by <i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/renaissance-a-film-by-beyonce/827021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renaissance: A Film by BeyoncÃ©</a></i> â€“ part documentary and part concert film.Â </p>

<p>Reuniting with Emma Stone once again, the director co-wrote the screenplay for his upcoming filmÂ <i>Kinds Of Kindness</i> (previously known as <i>And</i>) with Efthimis Filippou. Hereâ€™s everything we know about <i>Kinds Of Kindness</i>, including the filmâ€™s star-studded cast and a new teaser trailer.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It doesnâ€™t matter what time of year it is, building a new habit is difficult. We want to wake up earlier but weâ€™re exhausted after a couple of days of 6am starts. We vow to eat 30 plants a week but soon find that weâ€™re back to making the same old meals every day.  </p>
<p>But one increasingly popular way of diverting habit hell and making it to the resolution promised land is using a habit tracker. Designed to help people keep track of the behaviours they want to implement and celebrate their successes, habit trackers are everywhere these days and come in various forms, including standalone habit tracker pads, apps and journals.</p>
<p>But is keeping track of our behaviour in this way an effective technique for building healthy habits? Does ticking off small wins make introducing new routines easy? Or do habit trackers oversimplify the hard work required to make a routine second nature? We asked the experts for their take on this trending approach.Â 
	  </p>
<h2>What are the benefits of using habit trackers?Â </h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="A woman using a habit tracker" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2024/01/08152651/habit-tracker-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We all know how important it is to celebrate the small wins, and habit trackers are a brilliant way to tap into this feeling, especially if youâ€™re someone who likes to visualise your progress.  </p>
<p>â€œThe most important feature of a habit tracker is the sense of progression it offers,â€ saysÂ <a href="https://www.drritarakus.co.uk/clinic/clinicians/dr-galyna-selezneva" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Galyna Selezneva</a>Â a psychiatrist and aesthetic doctor. â€œIt allows you to keep a better eye on your own activity, build self-awareness and reduce self-sabotage, and frequently tracking progress towards your goals is incredibly motivating.â€ </p>
<p>It might not seem like habit trackers have the power to stop you from sabotaging your progress, but their ability to make you accountable for your actions â€“ by ticking things off day by day â€“ is a useful tool to keep you focused. </p>
<p>Michele Ferron, founder of <a href="https://www.onceuponatuesday.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Once Upon A Tuesday</a>, a stationery brand that counts habit trackers among its offerings, adds that habit trackers are a useful â€œvisual reminderâ€ of the goals youâ€™ve set.  </p>
<p>And while using a digital habit tracker may not be quite as visually prominent, the satisfaction of ticking off your daily tasks â€“ as well as seeing them add up over time â€“ can be equally motivating.Â Â </p>
<h2>Are there any downsides to using a habit tracker?Â </h2><p>A habit tracker can be a useful tool when youâ€™re introducing new behaviours, but only if you take the time to use it properly. After all, a habit tracker isnâ€™t some magical quick fix: you need to put in the effort and know what youâ€™re trying to achieve if you want your new habits to stick. </p>
<p>Failing to make your new habits clear and achievable is one of the biggest mistakes people make, Ferron says. â€œHabit trackers are only effective if you formulate your habits in a certain way,â€ she explains. â€œâ€˜Eating healthyâ€™ is too big a habit to start with â€“ itâ€™s too easy to break and then abandon because itâ€™s too overwhelming. In my experience, itâ€™s best to break that down into small habits you build over time.â€ </p>
<p>If you want to eat a healthier diet, that might mean starting with a goal to eat a certain number of plants per week or cooking a healthy meal from scratch once every couple of days. To begin with, those tasks might feel quite challenging, but over time they should become easier. Then, once they donâ€™t feel so overwhelming, you can set yourself new goals to tackle, so youâ€™re slowly adding to the number of behaviours youâ€™ve ticked off.Â </p>

<p>Inspired to start habit tracking? Here are some tips to ensure you get the most out of your new approach. </p>
<h3>1. Start small </h3>
<p>You wouldnâ€™t try to run a marathon after one day of training, so donâ€™t set yourself up for failure by forcing yourself to make a bunch of big changes. Start with one or two habits, and make sure theyâ€™re realistic. </p>
<h3>2. Share your journey with others </h3>
<p>â€œCommunity support is one of the best tools you can use to build new habits,â€ Dr Selezneva says. â€œSharing your journey and exchanging support with those who are passionate about your success is important.â€ </p>
<p>To do this, you could try keeping your habit tracker in a shared area of your home or simply sharing updates with a trusted friend or family member at various points throughout your journey. This will not only help to keep you accountable, but also give you someone to celebrate with when you reach important milestones. </p>
<h3>3. Prioritise simplicity </h3>
<p>There are plenty of different habit trackers out there these days but try not to opt for one thatâ€™s too complicated or long-winded. Designers like Ferron have made products that are incredibly easy to use. And if you donâ€™t fancy investing in a habit tracker app or physical pad to start with, then you can create your own using a pen and paper â€“ simply write down your habit and put a tick next to every day you manage to achieve it.Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brace yourself: <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/astrology/mercury-retrograde-funny-tweets-memes/535612" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mercury retrograde</a> is officially around the corner, and that means chaos is about to reign. There are three Mercury retrogrades in 2024, and the first one begins on 1 April. This spells disruption in the realms of communication and travel, so anticipate typo-packed emails, misunderstood messages and many delayed trains.Â </p>
<p>But donâ€™t panic too much: there are ways to survive this rocky period. Ahead youâ€™ll find your need-to-know guide to all things Mercury retrograde.Â </p>
<h2>What is a Mercury retrograde?</h2><div>A retrograde simply means that a planet appears to be going backwards, rather than its usual forwards orbit. Of course, Mercury never <i>actually </i>reverses its spin, as that would be a pretty major planetary catastrophe, but due to all the planetsâ€™ orbits around the sun, along with the Earthâ€™s rotations, there are points when it will look closer to us and as though itâ€™s sped on ahead.Â </div>
<p>The times when Mercury appears to go backwards occur every 88 days (the length of the planetâ€™s cycle around the sun), meaning you usually get three retrogrades in a year.</p>
<h2>When is Mercury in retrograde in 2024?</h2><p>Youâ€™ve got three Mercury retrogrades to prepare for this year. The first one hit from 21 April to 14 May, and was in the sign of Taurus. Next up, thereâ€™s a Mercury retrograde that goes from 23 August to 15 September, then finally, thereâ€™s one in Capricorn and Sagittarius, between 13 December and 1 January 2024.Â </p>
<p>The last Mercury retrograde of 2023 ended on 1 January 2024, but Mercury will be in retrograde three more times in 2024: 1 April 1, 2024 to 25 April, 5 August to 27 August and 25 November to 15 December.Â </p>
<h2>How will Mercury retrograde impact us?</h2><p>Astrology fans believe that Mercury retrograde affects us all, regardless of our star signs. Because Mercury is the planet thought to rule communication, travel and logical thinking, when it goes retrograde, these are the areas it affects negatively.Â </p>
<p>This means that throughout Mercury retrograde, you might experience issues with communication â€“ think crossed wires in conversations, accidentally missing an important work email, WhatsApping the person you were bitching about rather than the mate you intended; travel â€“ missed flights, train delays, your favourite shoes falling apart; and logical thinkingÂ â€“ emotions may be heightened, so thinking rationally can be tough.</p>
<p>Youâ€™re not doomed to a terrible few weeks, of course, but things might just be a littleâ€¦ trickier, particularly in these areas. The good news is there are ways to navigate it.Â </p>

<h2>How to get through the Mercury retrograde</h2><h3><b>Give yourself more time for travelÂ </b></h3>
<p>If you know a journey usually takes an hour, perhaps give yourself a little bit of a cushion on either side. Leave 15 minutes earlier than you think.Â </p>
<p>Why? Because Mercury retrograde has a rep for really messing with all things travel related. Expect cancelled buses, trains stuck at stations and a puncture in your bike tyre. Giving yourself a little extra time in case of any bumps in the road will lessen the stress.Â </p>
<h3><b>Triple check all messagesÂ </b></h3>
<p>Mercury retrograde also tends to mess with communication. To avoid any mishaps, make this a time youâ€™re super stringent with checking, checking and checking one more time. That goes for emails, texts, WhatsApps, the lot. Watch out for embarrassing typos, important emails landing in your spam folder, and texts sent to the wrong people. Better safe than sorry.</p>
<h3><b>Donâ€™t have any big, important conversations during this time</b></h3>
<p>On the topic of communication, perhaps consider holding any big, important chats until Mercuryâ€™s back to normal. This is a time when misinterpretation is rife and communication might hit blocks.Â </p>
<h3><b>Triple check all your travel tickets and timings</b></h3>
<p>Weâ€™ve already warned you about travel issues, but hereâ€™s a reminder. Have a proper look at any booked tickets and planned trips to ensure youâ€™ve got everything nailed. If thereâ€™s a time when youâ€™ll turn up for a flight on the wrong day, itâ€™s Mercury retrograde.Â </p>
<h3><b>Remain calm</b></h3>
<p>Please remember that all this Mercury retrograde chat is highly theoretical, and could well be total nonsense. Even if it actually <i>does </i>have an impact, stressing about the potential chaos wonâ€™t help matters. Donâ€™t catastrophise, donâ€™t assume everythingâ€™s doomed, and take some time for deep, slow, calming breaths when any issues rear their head. Remain laidback and youâ€™ll be far better equipped to deal with whatever mix-ups occur.Â </p>
<h3><b>Do a digital detox day </b></h3>
<p>On the note of bad communication, perhaps Mercury retrograde is a good time to down tools and steer clear of social media and screens, where thereâ€™s potential for things to go badly. Always nice to have an excuse for <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/digital-detox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a phone-free day</a>, right?Â </p>
<h3><b>Reminisce and reflect </b></h3>
<p>The clueâ€™s in the name: the retrograde also brings a â€˜blast from the pastâ€™ energy. Itâ€™s a great time to reminisce on good times and reflect on what youâ€™ve learned. Rather than taking action during Mercury retrograde, have some space to think back over the pastâ€¦ and brace yourself for long-gone exes and friends to make an appearance, as that often happens during retrogrades, too.Â </p>
<h3><b>Embrace the challenge</b></h3>
<p>Look, sometimes things go wrong, retrograde or no retrograde. <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/how-accepting-things-will-go-wrong-can-make-you-happier/758862" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accepting this is a key first step in better dealing with stress</a>, but the next step is embracing it. When things donâ€™t go to plan, consider what you can learn as a result. Pat yourself on the back for overcoming struggles. Take on the challenges in your path as a chance to display your problem-solving skills and resilience. Youâ€™ve got this.Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>â€˜Feathered hairâ€™ describes a haircut with loads of layers that creates a tumbling, light and plumage-esque effect about the ends. Itâ€™s perfect for <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/big-hair-volume-trend/867681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adding a bit of volume</a>, since the ends arenâ€™t weighed down. Think the opposite of â€˜bluntâ€™, and youâ€™ll get the idea. </p>
<p>Feathered hair has had a bit of a branding problem since the heyday of icon Farrah Fawcett, who was so famous for rocking the style that her headshot is the photo on the Wikipedia page for the cut. </p>
<p>But with the likes of BeyoncÃ© dabbling with feathered layers recently, and bobs having utterly <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/why-is-the-2024-bob-haircut-trend-so-popular/866193" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taken over the world</a>, combining the two just feels right.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lorealprofessionnel.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lâ€™OrÃ©al Professionnel UK </a>editorial artist Louis Byrne tells<i> Stylist</i>: â€œAs we step into spring there is a desire from clients to change up their style for something new and fresh. Weâ€™ve seen long-waved locks as a prominent look in the fashion space this year. However, the constant heat styling can take its toll on the hair. This is why the feathered layers and bobs are so popular right now, as these styles will allow for healthier-looking hair while also creating balance, shape and form for more bounce and volume.â€</p>
<div class="iframely-instagram iframely-app iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="BeyonceÌ on Instagram" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/fj6HtNi?maxheight=1200&app=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2>How can feathered layers work with a bob?</h2>
<p>Byrne explains: â€œItâ€™s the feathered layers that bring out individual personality in a bob. A good hair cutter will know where to take the layers and how much to feather according to your features. Always invest in a good haircut, as this should last you between three and five months. Itâ€™s also very important to take good care of your hair between salon appointments. I recommend always finishing with an oil for added shine and to keep ends hydrated.â€</p>
<h2>How will a feathered bob look on different hair textures? </h2>
<p>â€œThe feathered bob works on all hair textures,â€ says Byrne, â€œas long as it is cut well. I recommend booking a consultation with your stylist before to explain exactly what you want from this cut. Your stylist will then be able to advise you, depending on your hair type and texture. I actually use feathering in all my haircutting to personalise the cut with an undone but precise finish to ensure the hairstyle fits each of my clients.â€</p>
<h2>What to tell your stylist if you want to get the look</h2>
<p>Byrne says: â€œFirst of all,&nbsp; you need to find the right stylist for you. Research their work beforehand to ensure they are the right fit for the style you want. Make sure you tell your stylist you would like a feathering technique, because using thinning scissors will not get you the same results â€“ they will make your hair look drier and wirier. I also recommend asking for colour to enhance the texture of this style.â€</p>

She agrees to dog-sit for her sister in Los Angeles for a summer, where she joins a love addiction group and goes on a string of Tinder excursions.

<p>Itâ€™s a darkly funny, erotic and, at times, uncomfortable story, which takes a refreshing and sharp take on what romance, fertility, ambition, identity, pleasure, boundaries and love all mean for women today.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When was the last time you stepped off your hamster wheel? You know the one â€“ it makes you feel like youâ€™re always busy but never accomplishing as much as you need to, whether thatâ€™s at work or at home (or often both). Perhaps you only ever<b>Â </b>take a break when you go on holiday. Maybe youâ€™re able to relax every other Sunday. But if these periods of peace are few and far between, youâ€™re not alone. According to the Mental Health Foundation, 74% of UK adults have been so stressed at some point over the last year they felt overwhelmed or unable to cope. And for women, this number rises to 81%, compared with 67% for men. </p>
<p>While advice for how to halt this hamster wheel is everywhere â€“ meditation, daily walks and booking annual leave are among the usual suggestions â€“ sometimes, these fixes donâ€™t quite cut through. So, we put together a panel of productivity experts to share the nuggets of advice that help them streamline their days. From the easy hack to stop meetings making you busier to the scheduling technique a time management coach swears by, hereâ€™s what they told usâ€¦Â </p>
<h2>Get things done in your meetingsÂ </h2><p><b>Helen Tupper is the co-founder of Squiggly Careers and author of <i>You Do You: How To Overcome Challenges And Take Control Of Your Career</i>. </b></p>
<p>â€œWhen Iâ€™m trying to maximise my time to make my work fit my capacity, my first port of call is to look at my meetings. Weâ€™re often going from meeting to meeting and accumulating actions in those meetings â€“ sometimes leaving them even busier than we were before we went in. To prevent me from leaving the meeting with a huge to-do list I donâ€™t have time for, Iâ€™ll often just say: â€œCan we get this sorted now?â€ The more we can do actually in the meetings, rather than carrying them over to our to-do list or subsequent meetings, the better. </p>
<p>â€œOne example is when someone asks everyone to have a look at their diaries once the meetingâ€™s over to see when we can all arrange another time to talk. Rather than five people going off and looking in their diaries, Iâ€™ll suggest finding a time there and then. Similarly, if someone suggests touching base with a colleague to see whether they can come to the next meeting, as thatâ€™s a two-minute job, Iâ€™ll say: â€œWhy donâ€™t you carry on this conversation, and Iâ€™ll just take two minutes to get that sorted?â€ Equally, you could arrange a 45-minute meeting (rather than an hour) to give everyone a 15-minute window for all the follow-up actions. We donâ€™t naturally leave ourselves that time, so making a conscious effort to slot it in will leave you a lot less overwhelmed.â€Â </p>
<h2>Make an inventory of â€˜shouldsâ€™Â </h2><p><b>Madeleine Dore is a writer specialising in routines and the author of <i>I Didnâ€™t Do The Thing Today: On Letting Go Of Productivity Guilt</i>. </b></p>
<p>â€œSomething I do regularly is make an inventory of my own â€˜shouldsâ€™, because I think when we have that busy feeling, itâ€™s important to check where thatâ€™s coming from. It might be the sheer volume of work, but it could be that there are some â€˜shouldsâ€™ in there. Maybe itâ€™s something you told yourself five years ago that you should do and itâ€™s since expired as a goal for you, yet youâ€™re still feeling bad about not getting to it. It could also be something thatâ€™s borrowed, that youâ€™ve observed through comparison to other people or have been told we need to do by other people, be it our parents or our peers. </p>
<p>Iâ€™ll do a complete brain dump of all the things Iâ€™m telling myself onto paper and then label what I need to do versus what is a â€˜shouldâ€™, and where it came from. This inventory of seeing whatâ€™s expired or whatâ€™s borrowed helps us to prioritise. Sometimes, it can feel tricky because we might be letting go of a goal weâ€™ve defined ourselves by. But itâ€™s about determining what we really want to be doing â€“ whether our days are filled more with â€˜shouldsâ€™ or with things we really want to â€“ or have to â€“ be doing.â€Â </p>
<h2>Trigger yourself into taking brain resets</h2><p><b>Dr Aditi Nerurkar is a Harvard doctor, stress expert and author of <i>The Five Resets</i>.</b></p>
<p>â€œBrain breaks arenâ€™t just nice luxuries; they have a real impact on your brainâ€™s resilience to stress and burnout. In fact, a recent study with Microsoft took brain scans of two groups; one group had no breaks during the day and the second group took short breaks throughout. They found that at the end of the day, the group that took those short breaks had decreased stress and burnout, and better cognition, attention and memory productivity. Effectively, they taking were brain resets. Studies have shown that even a 10 second break can have a benefit, and tapping into your mind-body connection is the best way to spend this reset time. </p>
<p>â€œI call it â€˜stop, breathe, beâ€™. Stop what youâ€™re doing, take a deep breath and ground your feet to feel centred. The best way to introduce these into your day is to set yourself triggers. For me, as a doctor, itâ€™s just before I knock on the door to introduce myself to a patient. It might be before you click â€˜join Zoomâ€™, or when youâ€™re making your lunch in the morning, or just before you leave to take your kids to school. Anxiety and overwhelm are future-focused emotions, so grounding yourself in the present is one of the most valuable 10 seconds you can give yourself.â€ &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Map out your days with time blockingÂ <br></h2><p><b style="">Sarah Stewart is a time management coach and former project manager. </b></p>
<p>â€œI encourage all my clients to give time blocking a try. In essence, itâ€™s simply about assigning specific tasks to a block and putting that block in your calendar â€“ planning ahead of time, in other words. This can be as detailed (setting out exactly what tasks youâ€™ll do in the block) or as unstructured (just theming each block) as you like, but it can be so beneficial for helping you feel more on top of things and less busy. </p>
<p>â€œAlthough I now use a digital calendar for mine (checking in weekly to reflect on the week just gone and plan the next), I encourage everyone new to time blocking to start on paper. At the beginning, doing it digitally can be a bit â€˜out of sight, out of mindâ€™ so Iâ€™d recommend putting your plan somewhere visible, like on your fridge. Colour coding different types of tasks (whether this is different facets of your job or coding work v leisure) can help you make sure things are balanced, and as the weeks go on, youâ€™ll feel more able to predict how much time you need for certain things. Remember: your time-blocking plan doesnâ€™t need to be set in stone; itâ€™s more of a guide that helps us feel more prepared for the week. Follow the 80/20 rule: if you can stick to it 80% of the time, thatâ€™ll make a huge difference.â€Â </p>
<h2>Try a magic Post-it note</h2><p><b>Ali Abdaal is a doctor, one of the worldâ€™s most-followed productivity experts and author of <i>Feel Good Productivity: How To Do More Of What Matters To You</i>.Â <br /></b></p>
<p>â€œAfter watching <i>Mary Poppins</i> one day back when I was a junior doctor (â€œIn every job that must be done, there is an element of fun. You find the fun and snap! The jobâ€™s a game,â€<b> </b>says Mary Poppins), I decided to apply the filmâ€™s philosophy to my own life. In a late-night burst of inspiration, I grabbed a Sharpie and a Post-it note and wrote nine simple words: <i>what would this look like if it were fun?</i> I stuck the note to my computer monitor and went to sleep.Â </p>
<p>â€œBy the time I spotted the note on my monitor the following day, Iâ€™d forgotten Iâ€™d put it there. Iâ€™d just got back from work and was making a start on relearning some biochemistry pathways for my medical exam. I sat down with my usual grin-and-bear-it expression. But when I saw the Post-it it got me thinking again. What would this look like if it were fun? The answer came to me immediately: if this were fun, there would be music. I realised that memorising tedious biochemistry pathways magically became a lot more interesting with the <i>Lord Of The Rings</i> soundtrack playing through my headphones.  </p>
<p>â€œâ€˜What would this look like if it were fun?â€™ has now become a guiding question in my life. And itâ€™s surprisingly easy to draw upon. Think of a task that you donâ€™t want to do right now and ask what would it look like if it were fun. Could you do it in a different way? Could you add music or a sense of humour or get creative? What if you set out to do the task with friends, or promised yourself a treat at the end of the process? Is there a way to make this draining process a little more enjoyable?â€Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dare I say it: weâ€™ve finally entered spring. Alongside more hours of daylight and cherry blossoms blooming, the beauty industry saw an abundance of brighter, fresher and fun-er formulas hit the shelves.</p>
<p>Of course, this time of year typically sees the arrival of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/skincare/best-spf-face-according-to-dermatologists-skin-experts/503123" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">numerous SPFs</a>, but Ultra Violetteâ€™s comes with added bronzing or illuminating benefits. Meanwhile, Lisa Eldridgeâ€™s new <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/make-up/best-mascaras/495007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smudge-proof mascara</a> delivers ultra-long lashes and Jo Maloneâ€™s latest <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/spring-summer-2023-perfume/772420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refreshing scent</a> will become a springtime staple.</p>
<p>In particular, it was the month of brilliant make-up formulas, many of which launched straight into <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/tiktok-beauty-products/478658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">viral territory</a>. Milk Make-upâ€™s Cooling Water Jelly Tints have been a regular feature on my TikTok FYP, thanks to its satisfyingly wobbly jelly texture, while Lâ€™OrÃ©al Parisâ€™s True Match Lumi Glotion gained cult status Stateside â€“ and has <i>finally</i> come to the UK.</p>
<p>Here, I run through the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/make-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make-up</a>, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/skincare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skincare</a>, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/hair" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">haircare</a> and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/perfume" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fragrance</a> products that I couldnâ€™t stop swiping, sweeping and spritzing on during the month of March.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you work in an office, youâ€™re likely gearing up for four days off over the Easter break. With Christmas feeling like a lifetime ago, the long weekend â€“ our first bank holiday of the year â€“ is an overdue reward at the end of winter and it truly signifies the start of spring.  </p>
<p>So, itâ€™s no surprise that weâ€™re planning to make the most of every minute of our time off. We might be losing an hour in bed with the clocks changing on Sunday, but with lighter and longer days on the horizon, itâ€™s set to be worth the wait. And the only thing that can make it any better is a celebratory seasonal bake. Luckily,Â <i><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/4756/9781529915518" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chocolate Overload!</a></i>Â by cook and food blogger Jessie Marsden-Urquhart is here to help.Â </p>

<h4 class="listicle__title">Cracked egg chocolate cupcakes </h4>
<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p><b>Jessie says: </b>â€œDecorated with an oozing chocolate egg, these cupcakes have an extra mini egg baked into the sponge and are topped with swirls of silky chocolate buttercream. Pure chocolate overload!â€</p>
<p><i>Makes 12</i></p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<p>For the cupcakes</p>
<ul>
<li>12 mini filled chocolate eggs (I use Cadbury Mini Creme Eggs)</li>
<li>180g unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
<li>180g caster sugar</li>
<li>2 medium eggs, room temperature</li>
<li>150g self-raising flour</li>
<li>30g cocoa powder</li>
</ul>
<p>For the buttercream:</p>
<p>200g salted butter, room temperature</p>
<ul>
<li>350g icing sugar</li>
<li>50g cocoa powder</li>
<li>2 tbsp boiling water</li>
</ul>
<p>Decoration:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 filled chocolate eggs (I use Cadbury Creme Eggs)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Method</b></p>
<p>Place the mini chocolate eggs in the freezer for at least an hour before starting the recipe.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180Â°C/160Â°C fan and line a 12-hole cupcake tin with 12 paper cases.</p>
<p>Cream the butter and caster sugar together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Then fold in the flour and cocoa powder to make a smooth chocolate cake mixture. Fill each case with a thin layer of mixture.</p>
<p>Unwrap the frozen mini chocolate eggs and place one upright in the middle of each case. Spoon more mixture on top to conceal the eggs, filling each case three-quarters full.</p>
<p>Bake for 20â€“22 minutes until risen and springy to the touch. Leave to cool on a wire rack.</p>
<p>To make the buttercream, beat the butter in a bowl until soft and pale in colour. Sift in the icing sugar and beat until combined. Beat in the cocoa powder and boiling water to make a smooth and creamy chocolate buttercream.</p>
<p>Spread or pipe tall swirls of buttercream on top of each cupcake. Use a sharp knife to halve the full-sized chocolate eggs so you have 12 halves in total. Top each cupcake with half an egg, letting the filling ooze out onto the buttercream. Enjoy!</p>

<p><i>Serves 1</i></p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<ul>
<li>3 tbsp self-raising flourÂ </li>
<li>1 tbsp light brown sugar</li>
<li>Â½ tsp ground cinnamon, plus extra for dusting</li>
<li>Â½ tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
<li>2 tbsp milk</li>
<li>10g raisins</li>
<li>5 chocolate orange eggs (I use Terryâ€™s Chocolate Orange Mini Eggs)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Method</b></p>
<p>Stir the flour, brown sugar and ground cinnamon together in a medium-sized microwaveable mug. Mix in the vanilla extract, sunflower oil and milk until smooth. Stir in the raisins and chocolate orange eggs.</p>
<p>Microwave on full power for approximately 90 seconds (the cooking time may differ by 10â€“20 seconds, depending on how powerful your microwave is). The mug cake is ready when it has risen and started to pull away from the sides.</p>
<p>To decorate, cut two strips of kitchen paper and lay them on top of the mug cake in a cross. Dust with ground cinnamon, then carefully lift off the strips to reveal the cross. Grab a spoon and get stuck in!</p>

From mixing bowl to first bite in less than an hour, thereâ€™s no excuse not to experiment and find your favourite flavour.â€</p>
<p><i>Makes 12</i></p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<ul>
<li>150g unsalted butter</li>
<li>100g caster sugar</li>
<li>150g light brown sugar</li>
<li>1 medium egg, room temperature</li>
<li>1 medium egg yolk, room temperature</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>275g self-raising flour</li>
<li>Â½ tsp salt</li>
<li>300g mini chocolate eggs (I use a mix of Cadbury Mini Eggs, Galaxy Golden Eggs, Milkybar Mini Eggs and Smarties Mini Eggs)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Method</b></p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200Â°C/180Â°C fan. Then line a 20cm square baking tin with</p>
<p>greaseproof paper.</p>
<p>Place the butter in a large heatproof bowl and melt in the microwave for 30â€“60 seconds until it turns to liquid. Mix in the two sugars, the egg, egg yolk and vanilla extract until combined. Fold in the flour and salt to make a thick cookie dough. Fold 250g of the mini chocolate eggs into the dough, then press out into the baking tin. Use a rolling pin to bash the remaining eggs into pieces and scatter them over the top.</p>
<p>Bake for 18â€“20 minutes. The cookie bars should look golden and set on top, with a slight wobble underneath. Leave to cool in the baking tin for 30 minutes, then slice into 12 bars and serve!</p>
<p><b>Baking tip:</b></p>
<p>Cookie bars will continue to cook as they cool down, so itâ€™s best to underbake them. If in doubt, take them out!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No matter if youâ€™re warming up for <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/wedding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wedding season</a>, getting excited at the prospect of al fresco drinks or simply looking to elevate your everyday <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/how-to-dress-for-work-workwear-formula/874284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office outfits</a>, this is the season to be swapping your winter boots for lighter, airier shoes. And if you want to combine comfort with a more formal fit, low-heeled finds are some of the best styles to choose from.</p>
<p>Luckily, as our love for <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/best-bright-colourful-trainers/857359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trusty trainers</a>, jeans and gym kit only seems to be growing, so too do comfortable clothing options. <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/why-a-quilted-floral-jacket-is-the-ultimate-spring-wardrobe-elevator/871180" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spring jackets</a> are becoming cosier, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/weekend-trousers-comfy/868188" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tailored trousers</a> have morphed into more weekend-friendly fits andÂ â€“ if the increasing number of both high street and high-end options is anything to go byÂ â€“ high heels are shrinking and shorter, less ankle-harming styles are certainly trending.Â </p>
<p>So thereâ€™s now no need to diligently layer on the blister plasters before you make moves on the dance floor (or wince as you walk home). And to give you even more of a helping hand, weâ€™ve handpicked our nine favourite low-heeled shoe styles below â€“ sandals, pumps and Mary Janes all included.Â </p>

			<description>Buccal massage may have once been the preserve of aesthetic clinics, but itâ€™s an increasinglyÂ  popular way to treat tooth grinding. Stylistâ€™s Miranda Larbi has been down to My Osteo London to see what itâ€™s like to have someone elseâ€™s hands massage the inside of your mouth.Â </description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine the scene: itâ€™s 8.30am on a Wednesday morning and Iâ€™m lying in a bright, lightly scented room as two gloved fingers work in the inside of my left cheek. The past 30 minutes have been spent having my jaw externally rubbed, tapped and knuckled, and now weâ€™ve gone <i>inside</i>. <a href="https://www.myosteolondon.com/your-osteopath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Osteopath Charlotte Mernier</a> has her two index fingers in each corner of my mouth and is lifting what feels like a whole lot of flesh up, so that my top lip is now curled under my nose.Â </p>
<p>Iâ€™m having a buccal massage â€“ a treatment thatâ€™s huge on TikTok (96 million views and counting) but which until recently, Iâ€™d only heard of in relation to anti-ageing trends. These days, itâ€™s become a go-to therapy for tooth grinding â€“ something Iâ€™ve been struggling with in recent years. In fact, my nocturnal bruxism is so bad that last summer, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/grinding-teeth-mouth-guard-warning/808871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I cracked a tooth</a> and had to have my first crown fitted.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nhsdentist-earlscourt.co.uk/features/bruxism-grinding-or-clenching-your-teeth/#:~:text=It%20is%20not%20known%20exactly,in%20adults%20aged%2025%2D44." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Up to 10% of the population lives with tooth grinding</a>, with people aged 25-44 said to be the worst affected. The cause? Why, stress and anxiety of course.Â Weâ€™re at an age where everyone seems to be juggling careers with the next stages of life, whether thatâ€™s trying to buy a home, fork out for yet <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/weddings/hen-do-party-planning-tips-and-ideas/872076" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another hen do</a>, have kids or simply try to stay afloat amid a torrent of depressing domestic and international news. No wonder weâ€™re chomping through our molars every night.Â </p>
<p>I didnâ€™t know that I ground my teeth until that tooth cracked, but the signs had been there for years. The sides of my mouth are often lined from chewing and I get headaches semi-frequently. More recently, Iâ€™ve been hearing a whooshing sound â€“ like blood rushing around my eardrum â€“ that I often try to down out with the radio.  </p>
<p>Aside from flattened tooth edges and cracks, the main symptom dentists often mention is jaw tightness. You might know someone whose jaw clicks when they chew or you might find that your jaw starts to ache when you laugh â€“ those are obvious signs. But it wasnâ€™t until my face was being pummelled by Mernierâ€™s expert fingers that I realised just how ridiculously tight my own jaw is.Â </p>
<h2>What happens in a buccal massage?</h2><p>From TikTok, you might think that the whole session is spent with someoneâ€™s hands in your mouth. In reality, the intraoral part only lasts a few minutes and serves to stretch and massage harder-to-reach areas of the face. The majority of the massage is external. </p>
<p>Mernier starts by pushing down my shoulders, gently rotating my head and giving my neck a deep rub. Then, she moves up to massage my whole face in long sweeping movements before getting to work on the jaw. Thereâ€™s rubbing, kneading, pulling, rocking, tapping â€“ every kind of stroke and touch possible. And after about 20 minutes, she hits a spot just under my right ear on the very top of my jaw which is incredibly sensitive. She stays on it, pressing and rubbing, and after a while, it feels like something moves. Itâ€™s then that I realise the blood rushing I keep hearing is linked to my jaw because, suddenly, my right ear feels a lot clearer.Â </p>
<p>Mernier tells me that <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/tinnitus-cause-symptoms/791975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tinnitus</a> is a common issue among teeth grinders; those phantom sounds are caused by our bone structures responding to all that grinding and clenching, and the more you clench, the more ringing youâ€™ll hear.</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="External massage" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2024/03/20151657/buccal-massage-2-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Miranda Larbi</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We finish with the internal massage, for which Mernier gloves up. Itâ€™s not uncomfortable at all and, unlike a dental appointment, you can swallow as normal. She doesnâ€™t go far into my mouth (itâ€™s not a whole hand situation) and you donâ€™t have to move at all. In fact, it feels pretty good to have someone move around your lips and cheek flesh.</p>
<h2>Does buccal massage work?</h2><p>After 60 minutes (which passes all too quickly), I get up, start talking and find that my face feels noticeably lighter. It feels like a weight has been lifted from somewhere and itâ€™s easier to open my mouth.</p>
<p>They say that your teeth shouldnâ€™t spend more than 20 minutes a day touching, but many of us simply arenâ€™t aware when weâ€™re clenching. I know Iâ€™m tense when typing on my laptop or cycling, but not conscious enough to do anything about it at the time. Leaving the clinic on Wimpole Street, I notice that my tongue is naturally resting on the roof of my mouth (the correct position) and that my molars are set comfortably apart.</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Internal buccal massage" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2024/03/20151647/buccal-massage-1-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Miranda Larbi</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Mernier sends me on my way with a few pieces of advice. One is not to rely on my retainer to break the habit: â€œPeople often still clench wearing their retainer as itâ€™s natural to bite down when thereâ€™s something there,â€ she says. Instead of wearing my retainer when working from home, she recommends trying to be more conscious about when I clench and grind during the day, making an active effort to retract the shoulders, take calming breaths and notice where my teeth and tongue are.</p>
<p>Given how incredible the treatment feels at the time and how instant the results are after, Iâ€™ve got to say that this is one of the best treatments Iâ€™ve ever had. Iâ€™ve already told three fellow retainer-wearers about it and Iâ€™m already looking to see when I might be able to go back for round two.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Iâ€™ve learned a few massage techniques that Iâ€™ll be doing on my jaw a couple of times a week.</p>

<p>But mood swings, hormonal breakouts and all those other typical <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/pms-symptoms/490748" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PMS symptoms</a>Â arenâ€™t the only ones that can crop up. Joint pain, while seemingly unrelated, is something many women go through in the week leading up to and during their period â€“ and itâ€™s all to do with the hormonal fluctuations and chemical changes that go on in our bodies during that time.Â </p>
<p>The same can also occur during menopause due to similar hormonal fluctuations. However, the longer-term nature of these changes mean that any potential niggles can become more serious, so understanding where they come from and how to deal with them is important.  </p>
<p>With all that in mind, we asked Dr Samantha Wild, a GP and clinical lead for womenâ€™s health at <a href="https://www.bupa.co.uk/health/payg/menopause-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bupa Health Clinics</a>, to tell us more about the link between hormones and joint pain.Â </p>
<h2>How are our joints and sex hormones linked?Â </h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="woman knee pain running" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2022/08/22092754/woman-knee-pain-running-1120x1120.jpg">

</figure>
<p>Both oestrogen and progesterone can impact how our joints feel and function, but itâ€™s oestrogen which experts believe is the prime culprit here. </p>
<p>â€œSex hormones like oestrogen play a large role in regulating and maintaining bone health,â€ Dr Wild explains. â€œOestrogen helps to protect your bones and joints by reducing inflammation and friction between them.â€ </p>
<p>There are many ways that oestrogen does this â€“ it <a href="https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/ar3148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can affect your cartilage</a>, also known as the connective tissue in your joints, as well as affect tendon and ligament elasticity. Oestrogen also has an anti-inflammatory effect, so itâ€™s great for reducing pre-existing inflammation in the joints. </p>
<p>Progesterone, which falls towards the very end of the luteal phase (ie the last couple of days before your period) also has a muscle-relaxing effect, so low levels of the hormone can make muscles tight and sore, potentially contributing to joint pain.Â </p>
<h2>Why do some people experience joint pain before their period?Â </h2><p>Levels of oestrogen and progesterone both decrease before our period â€“ and this could explain why some people experience joint soreness at this time.  </p>
<p>But the fall in these hormones can also have other effects, Dr Wild explains: â€œStudies shown that low oestrogen can increase your perception of pain.â€ </p>
<p>In short, you might be more sensitive to pain in that week before your period, so any small niggles might seem a lot more serious and disruptive.Â Â </p>
<p>Molecular compounds known as prostaglandins â€“ which are what cause the muscle and blood vessels of the uterus to contract to shed its lining â€“ could also play a role, Dr Wild adds: â€œWhen you start your period, prostaglandins are released â€“ and these molecular compounds are believed to be a trigger of joint and muscle pain.â€Â 
	  </p>
<h2>Why do some people experience joint pain during menopause?Â </h2><p>The fall in oestrogen which occurs during menopause means many of the joint-related symptoms of PMS are mirrored, but the longer-lasting absence of oestrogen means symptoms can be more severe or lead to bigger issues. </p>
<p>â€œAs oestrogen levels naturally fall in perimenopause, your joints may swell and become painful,â€ Dr Wild says. â€œSore joints are a frequent first symptom for those going through perimenopause.â€ </p>
<p>The decrease in oestrogen during menopause<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6332715/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> has also been linked to an increased risk of osteoarthritis</a>, perhaps due to the impact the hormone can have on cartilage.Â </p>
<h2>Can these changes put us at increased risk of injury?Â </h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="A woman running pain" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/21145844/woman-running-pain-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As with many womenâ€™s health issues, research into the role hormonal fluctuations play in the risk of injury is limited. But Dr Wild says that there is some evidence that fluctuations throughout the menstrual cycle could influence injury risk. </p>
<p>â€œSome studies indicate that muscle and tendon injuries are almost twice as likely to happen two weeks after your period (around the time of ovulation),â€ she says. â€œInjury has also been linked with the days around the time of your period starting.â€Â </p>
<h2>How to reduce hormone-related joint painÂ </h2><p>Even if youâ€™re experiencing pain on a monthly basis,  you can take steps to relieve some of the discomfort.  </p>
<p>In the short term, making sure youâ€™re getting enough sleep, taking part in some light exercise â€“ such as yoga or aerobics â€“ and taking over the counter painkillers and anti-inflammatories should take the edge off things.  </p>
<p>And in the long run, taking steps to support your bone and joint health can help to dampen the discomfort you experience or get rid of it altogether.  </p>
<p>Below are just some of the steps Dr Wild recommends: </p>
<h3>1. Keep active </h3>
<p>â€œExercise can help to care for both your physical and mental health, along with improving your joint flexibility and offering pain relief,â€ she explains. â€œSwimming, walking, pilates and yoga can offer good options to help keep you strong.â€ </p>
<p><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/best-at-home-workouts-tutorial-exercise-tips/369685" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strength training</a> is particularly beneficial for improving the stability of your joints, she adds. â€œAt least twice a week you should make time for strengthening activities. You donâ€™t need to join the gym or start lifting weights if you donâ€™t want to â€“ taking the stairs instead of the lift, carrying shopping and dancing all count as strengthening exercises.â€</p>
<p>Dr Wild continues: â€œ<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/how-to-become-more-flexible/403138" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Controlled stretching</a> can also be a good option if your joints are feeling sore. Just make sure to keep it gentle and build up slowly.â€</p>
<h3>2. Seek expert advice</h3>
<p>If your joint pain is getting in the way of your ability to function, there are experts who can help. A physiotherapist can target aches and pains and give you exercises to do at home to strengthen your joints, while your GP can provide pain relief and advise on next steps.</p>
<p>This is especially important during menopause, as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3855295/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can be prescribed</a> to help relieve joint pain and stiffness.</p>
<h3>3. Eat a bone-strengthening diet</h3>
<p>Eating a diet thatâ€™s rich in joint-friendly nutrients will ensure your joint health is supported throughout the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>â€œA diet rich in calcium, vitamin D and omega 3 fatty acids will help to support your bones and joints, along with helping manage other menopause symptoms like hot flushes and low mood,â€ Dr Wild explains.Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Food has long been used to help treat, prevent and stave off disease, and for good reason. It may not be the magic cure weâ€™d all like it to be, but diet truly can make a difference in the management of all sorts of conditions â€“ even those that have relatively little to do with the digestive system. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/women/endometriosis-types-stages/800879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Endometriosis</a> is a prime example. While following a specific diet may not take away the pain of lesions and growths, some foods and nutrients have been shown to reduce the impact of the condition on the body and support general wellbeing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, certain foods have been shown to amplify certain symptoms. This means diet can play a role in the severity of flare-ups, including those caused by the conditionâ€™s co-morbidities.</p>
<p>Below, we explore exactly what that means â€“ including the foods and nutrients to seek out when building an endometriosis-friendly diet.Â 
	  </p>
<h2>Why is diet important for those with endometriosis?Â </h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Woman eating breakfast" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2024/02/21122750/woman-eating-breakfast-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>â€œEndometriosis is a â€˜nutrient hungryâ€™ condition,â€ explains Lorna Driver-Davies, head of nutrition at the supplement brand <a href="https://www.wildnutrition.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wild Nutrition</a>. â€œThe biological and physiological drain the body is placed under to manage the effect of the lesions means many of those with endometriosis have been shown to have low nutrient status.â€ </p>
<p>In particular, research has shown that women with endometriosis tend to have depleted levels of vitamin D, zinc, vitamin A and vitamin B12. Low levels of iron and magnesium are also common â€“ the former due to the excess levels of bleeding the condition can cause, and the latter due to the stress it exerts on the body. </p>
<p>Eating well can also support women with endometriosis to recover better from surgical interventions, and help with both direct and indirect symptoms, such as fatigue, sleep issues and migraines. Conditions such as <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/how-to-deal-with-ibs/428231" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IBS</a>, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus â€“ all of which women with endometriosis have been shown to be at higher risk of developing â€“ can also be supported, in part, through dietary interventions.Â Â </p>
<h2>How to eat well with endometriosisÂ </h2><p>Targeting specific foods and nutrients is key to building an endometriosis-friendly diet, Driver-Davies explains. Her recommendations include:</p>
<h3>1. Get plenty of omega 3 fatty acids</h3>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Nuts, seeds and legumes laid out in a row on a beige surface" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2024/01/18103130/nuts-seeds-legumes-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Endometriosis is a condition characterised by inflammation, which means optimising the number of anti-inflammatory nutrients in your diet should be the goal.</p>
<p>Omega 3 is a key one to target, Driver-Davies says. â€œ<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/mediterranean-diet-omega-3-benefits/487376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Omega 3</a> is an anti-inflammatory and research shows a diet rich in omega 3 can reduce the development and progression of endometriosis and help with symptoms,â€ she explains.Â </p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s very common for endometriosis sufferers in the UK to be low in omega 3 because Brits donâ€™t love eating fish as much in comparison to Europeans, but itâ€™s important.â€Â </p>
<p>While omega 3 supplements are widely available, most people should be able to get all the omega 3 you need from your diet alone. Key sources of omega 3 include oily fish (such as mackerel, herring, sardines and salmon) as well as nuts and seeds (such as flaxseed, chia seed and walnuts).Â Â 
	  </p>
<h3>2. Take inspiration from the Mediterranean diet </h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/mediterranean-diet-omega-3-benefits/487376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mediterranean diet</a> is famed for its anti-inflammatory properties, so it can have a positive effect on the inflammation associated with endometriosis.  </p>
<p>â€œI am a big fan of the strong science behind this diet,â€ Driver-Davies says. â€œIts benefits for people with endometriosis make sense since its approach is anti-inflammatory, encouraging healthy fat intake, whole foods and plenty of colourful fruit and vegetables. Other research on fruit and vegetable intake has also been found to benefit endometriosis, such as increased antioxidant support.â€ </p>
<p>The Mediterranean diet is wide and varied, so itâ€™s easy to keep things interesting. You just want to make sure youâ€™re getting lots of fruit and vegetables as well as whole grains and healthy fats.Â </p>
<h3>3. Up your fibre intake</h3>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Vegetables" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/09/19094336/vegetables-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A high-fibre diet isnâ€™t just good for improving your gut health â€“ it can also relieve symptoms of endometriosis, Driver-Davies explains. The two benefits are linked because of the role our gut plays in regulating our oestrogen levels, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/women/oestrogen-dominance-signs-symptoms/853247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high levels of which</a> can exacerbate endometriosis symptoms such as cramping and pain.  </p>
<p>This is all because of something called the estrobolome â€“ a specific group of bacteria within the gut microbiome responsible for producing the enzyme that helps our body to regulate oestrogen. When the estrobolome is functioning well, this enzyme helps to stop excess levels of oestrogen being absorbed into the bloodstream, instead ensuring it passes through as waste.  </p>
<p>Increased fibre intake can positively impact this process by feeding the bacteria, ensuring they stay happy and healthy. But thatâ€™s not all.  </p>
<p>â€œFibre helps to keep bowel movements regular, which helps to make sure oestrogen is removed and does not build up,â€ Driver-Davies says. â€œIt also helps to feed the gut microbiome required for a healthy immune system.â€Â </p>
<p>This is important because the immune system has been shown to play a role in the development of endometriosis, so taking steps to support immune health may make a difference to the severity of symptoms. Enhancing the health of the gut microbiome can also help  </p>
<p>It is worth noting that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-abstract/33/4/715/4833874" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one study</a> found that cruciferous vegetables such as brussels sprouts and cabbage could slightly increase someoneâ€™s risk of developing endometriosis, despite these plants being high in fibre and containing a compound which can aid oestrogen metabolism. However, more research is needed to decipher whether this link is of legitimate concern.Â </p></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Squats are arguably the OG of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/how-to-build-leg-muscle-using-bodyweight-workouts-exercises-tips/399142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leg exercises</a>. Theyâ€™re probably the most <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/strength-training-fundamental-moves/507069" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commonly performed movements</a> in the gym, and we bet youâ€™d struggle to find a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/best-home-workouts-without-equipment-exercise-tips-keep-fit/368687" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strength training programme</a> that doesnâ€™t have a type of squat in it. </p>
<p>However, on Strong Women, weâ€™ve previously spoken about the fact that <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/should-everyone-squat/561396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">squats donâ€™t come naturally to everyone</a> â€“ and not all of us are designed to squat with big barbells thanks to differences in ankle, knee and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/lower-back-pain-hip-mobility-exercises/512635" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hip mobility</a>.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re looking for another lower body exercise to sub in for squats, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/how-to-do-a-lunge/368488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lunges</a> could be the best bet. They donâ€™t get quite the same hype as the squat, but they are a classic <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/compound-exercises-workouts-benefits/435603" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compound move</a>. So, are they as effective at working those vital lower body muscles?</p>
<h2>The difference between squats and lunges</h2><p>With  so many different ways to perform each of the movements (with <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/best-kettlebell-exercises/466272" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kettlebells</a> or <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/benefits-barbell-easy-exercises/497150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">barbells</a>, walking lunges or <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/reverse-lunge-how-to-do-technique-variations-benefits/399133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reverse lunges</a>, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/squats-leg-day-10-minute-workout/491459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sumo squat</a> or pause squat), comparing the two can get a little confusing. But if we take a basic squat and a basic lunge, with or without any type of resistance, â€œthey are very similar movements,â€ says <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coachelouise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elouise Millard</a>, head coach at <a href="https://f45training.co.uk/stratford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">F45 Stratford</a>. </p>
<p>Both involve bending your knees to lower your hips down to the ground. In the squat, youâ€™ll have your feet both planted on the ground mirroring each other, but lunges are performed while moving one foot in front of or behind the other, into a â€˜splitâ€™ position. That changes the outcome of the movement.Â </p>

<h3>You can squat heavier weights but lunges require more functional fitness</h3>
<p>â€œLunges are great for building unilateral strength and core stability and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/improve-stability-instability-training/579182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improving your balance</a>,â€ says Millard. These are all <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/functional-strength-training/441662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">functional skills</a> that serve a purpose in every day life beyond the gym. </p>
<p>Unilateral work helps us to be stable and strong on either side of our body. Thatâ€™s especially important given that we donâ€™t often pick things up off the floor with perfectly aligned feet. </p>
<p>The staggered stance of lunges mimics the movement of walking and running, building strength in the pattern we need every day. â€œReverse lunges are particularly good for this,â€ trainer Emma Obayuvana has previously told Strong Women. â€œThe movementâ€¦ mimics the direct body mechanics and muscles as running as you drive that reverse leg back up to standing.â€</p>
<h3>Lunges require more balance and stability than squats</h3>
<p>â€œLunges are more challenging on the body than the squat due to the increased amount of balance and coordination needed to perform the move,â€ says Millard. â€œFor that reason, beginners might want to start with squats before progressing to the lunge.â€</p>
<p>A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30676181/#:~:text=No%20significant%20difference%20in%20muscle,but%20not%20affected%20in%20lunge." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 paper published in the <i>Journal of Sport Rehabilitation</i></a>&nbsp;showed that total muscle activation was higher in a lunge than in a squat â€“ suggesting that the lunge makes more of your muscles work harder. But because of the weight distribution, itâ€™s usually easier and safer to lift heavier when squatting, rather than lunging.</p>
<h2>You need both lunges and squats in your routine</h2><h3></h3>
<p>Donâ€™t go thinking that the only way to build serious strength is through squatting. <a href="https://mtntactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Squating-v-Lunging-High-School-Study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a 2015 study</a>, researchers found that there wasnâ€™t any noteworthy difference between the squat and lunge on their measures of lower body power. â€œOne of the most peculiar findings in the study was that the lunge group actually improved more than the squat group on their 1RM squat (22.6% and 7.2%, respectively) and the squat group improved more than the lunge group on their 1RM lunge (22.1% and 13.6%, respectively),â€ the researchers wrote.</p>
<p>For that reason, â€œboth squats and lunges can have a place in your training programme,â€ says Millard. While opting for the move you prefer or that best suits your goals is important, squats and lunges clearly complement each other and together can work on building well-rounded strength and power. Rather than it being a question of either-or, why not find a place for both?&nbsp;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Running certainly isnâ€™t for the faint of heart. While the post-workout endorphins make it worth it, thereâ€™s no denying that it can leave you with throbbing <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/calf-muscles-pain-injury/570569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calves</a> and aching <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/best-hamstring-exercises-strength-training-leg-workout/387913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hamstrings</a>. One of the most common running complaints, though, is pain and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/best-hip-stretches-how-to-stretch-hips-flexors-workouts/369293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tightness in the hips</a>. </p>
<p>Mild hip soreness is normal after a long run (because youâ€™ve just been using the muscle to power your legs). But if you start to experience frequent <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/hip-flexor-tightness-sore-stretching-strengthening-benefits/410519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pain in the hips and pelvis</a> that makes putting one foot in front of the other feel like an impossible task, you may be dealing with irritation or weakness of the iliacus.</p>
<h2>What is the iliacus?</h2><p>â€œThe iliacus?â€ you might be thinking. â€œNever heard of it.â€Â </p>
<p>You probably have, but maybe not by that name. The iliacus is a key part of the larger and better-known hip flexor (the other main muscle being the psoas). Together, the iliacus and the psoas make up the hip muscle group that connects the spine with the inner hip. Essentially, it is these two muscles that kick into gear when you lift your leg. Â </p>
<p>As PT <a href="https://locketloves.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucy Arnold</a> puts it: â€œThe iliacus is a muscle covering the surface of the pelvic bone, ranging through the hip and groin area.â€</p>
<p>â€œSet within the hip region, the iliacus muscle contributes a lot to general function,â€ adds physiotherapist Miriam Daurat from <a href="https://ourhealthhub.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Health Hub</a>. â€œItâ€™s involved in walking and supporting posture to working with the psoas major muscle to create powerful hip and trunk flexion. These movements allow us to bend down to tie laces and pick things up â€“ as well as perform exercises like <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/ab-workout-strengthen-core-without-sit-ups/415188" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sit-ups</a> and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/how-to-do-an-ab-crunch-correctly/368184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crunches</a>.â€</p>

<h2>Can your iliacus cause hip pain while running?Â </h2><p>According to a 2011 survey, roughly 10% of runners experience hip pain at least once a year.&nbsp;The difficulty is that itâ€™s hard to pinpoint which muscle in the hip area is causing your pain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do you know if itâ€™s the iliacus that is contributing to poor <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/best-hip-stretches-how-to-stretch-hips-flexors-workouts/369293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hip mobility</a> and running pain?</p>
<p>â€œSymptoms of an irritated iliacus can include stiffness while running, decreased mobility and flexibility in hip flexors at the front of the thigh, as well as muscle tenderness,â€ Arnold says. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Daurat explains that exercise can easily cause irritation in the iliacus. â€œParticularly in running, these small muscles can be overused to the point of injury,â€ she says. â€œThe acceleration and deceleration in running, coupled with the forces travelling through the hips and legs, cause the tendon that attaches the iliopsoas to the femur to become irritated and inflamed.â€</p>
<p>Itâ€™s not just the running that causes pain, either. The ilacus has to contend with a whole day sat down, too. â€œRegular time spent sitting for prolonged periods can cause the muscle to shorten,â€ says Daurat. â€œReduced flexibility and weakness in the iliacus can result in hip stiffness and pain associated with muscle tightness.â€ A shortened iliacus can also result from skipping out on <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/stretching-during-strength-training/633878" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stretching after strength training</a> or, you guessed it, running.</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Woman doing a lunge to" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2022/04/06123033/gettyimages-1328500724-crop-1649244737-1264x1264.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>How to strengthen (and lengthen) your iliacus</h2><p>Itâ€™s important to keep the muscle both strong and supple â€“ especially if youâ€™re working on completing a running goal. Over time, tightness in the iliacus can lead to an â€˜anterior pelvic tiltâ€™,Â Daurat says. Thatâ€™s when the pelvis is tilted forwards, creating an arch in the back. â€œImagine the pelvis as a bucket of water â€“ an anterior pelvic tilt would be as if the bucket was angled to tip water out of the front,â€ she says.Â </p>
<p>If tightness in the iliacus causes this tilt, you may begin to experience back pain in the long term too. Here are some tips to help strengthen and lengthen your iliacus and banish hip tightness for good:</p>
<h3>Get up and move</h3>
<p>â€œMaking a point to break up episodes of prolonged sitting can go a long way to decrease the likelihood of muscles becoming shortened and irritating during a run,â€ suggests Daurat. â€œAfter 30 minutes of sitting it is important to stand up and move around for a few minutes.â€</p>
<h3>Stretch after a run</h3>
<p>Stretch, stretch, stretch. Before and after a run, try incorporating stretches like lunges and bridges into your routine. â€œWhile it is important to make sure the iliacus and other muscles are strong, it is vitally important to promote good flexibility to reduce the risk of injury and pain,â€ Daurat says.</p>
<p>â€œMany simple stretches can be done in the comfort of your home, including hanging leg and knee to chest stretches,â€ says Arnold. â€œBut,â€ she adds, â€œalways consult a professional before doing any intensive stretching to prevent further injury.â€</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It goes without saying: no one should have to choose between their job and their wellbeing. Yet a quarter of women working in UK offices say they have been shamed or pressured to return to work early when taking time off for health issues, new research by the <a href="https://www.frendo.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">womenâ€™s health startup frendo</a> has found.</p>
<p>Despite the government urging employers to do more to keep workers healthy and the growing prevalence of workplace conversations about staff health, stigma around female health conditions remains,</p>
<p>As a result, over a quarter (28%) of women say their company culture is not open when it comes to discussing health conditions and 27% say their employer is not very willing to make allowances for wellbeing issues.</p>
<p>And the impact isnâ€™t just physical. One in seven women (14%) say they have experienced discrimination in the workplace due to their health, such as being overlooked for promotions or excluded from team activities. Two in five of those who had been discriminated against (42%) did not vocalise their concerns to the staff who were placing them at a disadvantage, and the same proportion did not tell their HR department.Â 
	  </p>
<p>Itâ€™s no surprise, then, that Headspaceâ€™s sixth annual <a href="https://get.headspace.com/2024-workforce-state-of-mind" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workforce State of Mind</a> report also revealed this week that 77% of workers in the UK say stress has poorly impacted their physical health. Once again, the effects extend far beyond physical health, as 71% claim that work stress caused a personal relationship to end, with Gen X employees more likely (79%) than any other generation to report that work stress has led to a breakup or divorce. This strain is filtering its way into family dynamics too, with over a third of workers (40%) stating that work stress has impacted their childrenâ€™s mental health or their ability to care for their family.</p>

</figure>
<p>These figures are just the latest in a slew of concerning research into how our jobs are <i>really</i> impacting our wellbeing. Only last month, a worrying report suggested that over a third of young people experience mental illness, adding that 5% are currently <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/generation-sick-note-mental-health-time-off-work/868509" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed off work for mental health reasons</a>. Clearly, even with many companies moving towards more flexible working arrangements, still more needs to be done to allow women to prioritise their health â€“ something that should be a given, not an exception.Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Time really is a flat circle when it comes to trends. And with the<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/tiktok-fast-fashion-trends/614192" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> trend cycle</a> tending to move in increments of roughly 20 years, we might not be far away from another decade-obsession vibe-shift. After all, much as it might pain us to admit it, 2030 isnâ€™t actually that far away.</p>
<p>TheÂ <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/grammys-2024-side-parting-hair-trend/861672" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">side parting is already back</a>, lest we forget, and that got us thinking about all the hair trends we used to obsess over in those heady dip dye days.Â </p>
<p>Hairstylist, colourist and curl-and-coil expert Nicola Harrowell tells<i> Stylist</i>: â€œItâ€™s interesting to be around for trends the second time around. I remember my mother telling me, â€˜I used to dress just like you when I was youngerâ€™, and thinking that was absurd!â€</p>
<p>When asked what 2010s hair trends she thinks could be looming in our future, she had this to sayâ€¦</p>

<h2>Sidecuts and undercuts </h2>
<p>So many cool girls reached for the clippers during the 10s to flirt with a buzz cutÂ â€“ albeit without leaving all their locks on the bathroom floor. </p>
<p>Harrowell, whoâ€™s represented by Premier Hair & Makeup, says: â€œI think the undercut could make a comeback as things get more grungy after this Y2K phase passes. I love an undercut, and hopefully weâ€™ll see some new angles and placements this time.â€</p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Bold dip-dye </h2>
<p>Balayage and ombre highlights never really fell out of style, but the brightly coloured, high-contrast hairdos of the 2010s had a very specific vibe. </p>
<p>Harrowell says: â€œFun colours have come a long way, with brands like Curlsmith doing great wash-off shades. So Iâ€™m hoping, if dip-dye comes back, that it will be done with a lot less damage this time around.â€</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>

<h2>The bright bob</h2>
<p>Was <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/why-is-the-2024-bob-haircut-trend-so-popular/866193" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the bob,</a> a cut weâ€™re already obsessed with in 2024, just a 2010s trend? No, it was not. However, there were some notable crops on the likes of Hayley Williams and Rihanna in the early 10s that made a very specific, colourful statement. </p>
<p>â€œBobs are making a statement ahead of summer,â€ says Harrowell, adding that she suspects theyâ€™ll start to become â€œsuper-sharp and structuredâ€.</p>
<h2>Thinking beyond the trendsâ€¦</h2>
<p>But Harrowell also points out that, even though we might look to the past for inspiration, what people really want these days are looks that work for their unique hair types and curl patterns.</p>
<p>She explains: â€œI think people are also coming to terms with working out what might be best for them within the trends, instead of <i>solely </i>what is in fashion. The curly people are curly and the straight people are slick and structured, which always looks better to me as it feels natural.â€</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was February 2013, and at the 85th Academy Awards ceremony, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/anne-hathaway" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anne Hathaway</a> had just scooped the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/oscars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscar</a> for Best Supporting Actress. The win, by all accounts, was no great surprise: throughout the awards season that year, the actor had racked up trophies at the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/golden-globes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Globes</a>, SAG Awards and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/baftas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baftas</a> for her compelling portrayal of the doomed Fantine in the big screen adaptation of <i>Les MisÃ©rables</i>. Standing on stage at the most prestigious film awards in the world, Hathaway was about to experience a moment most actors dream of. Hollywoodâ€™s biggest night belonged to her.
	  </p>
<p>Except when Hathaway took the mic to deliver her acceptance speech, everything unravelled. As she cradled her golden statue and whispered, â€œIt came true!â€, the internet unleashed a tidal wave of vitriol. People mocked the darts on her powder pink Prada gown; her doe eyes and too-perfect mouth; her awed, overeager voice. Then there was the speech itself, which was branded rehearsed, calculated and disingenuous. There was no doubt about it: the Oscar-night darling was now public enemy number one.Â </p>
<p>After the 2013 awards season, the hatred heaped upon the actor became a big topic of conversation. Alongside the everyday cyberbullying, an abundance of think pieces attempted to compile evidence of Hathawayâ€™s most annoying qualities, from her earnest demeanour to her joyful exuberance. â€œSheâ€™s got this theatre kid thing where she adopts the mood of every situation sheâ€™s in [â€¦] but wildly overcompensates every time,â€ <a href="https://www.hollywood.com/celebrities/why-do-people-hate-anne-hathaway-55000498-60231034" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said critic Richard Lawson.</a>Â â€œShe always seems like sheâ€™s performing, and her favourite act is this overstated humility and graciousness.â€ In a bizarre scientific analysis, psychology professorÂ Terry Pettijohn argued that Hathawayâ€™s â€œmature faceâ€ was more suited to a challenging climate. â€œWhen times are good we prefer actresses with rounder faces,â€ he <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/28/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/anne-hathaway-hate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a>.Â So zealous was the public loathing that a new wordÂ â€“  HathahateÂ â€“  was created just to describe the movement.</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Anne Hathaway" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2017/10/24172244/932474c35b33d7258804be4218947f6c-734x734.jpg">

</figure>
<p>But while the discourse raged with revulsion, it also became clear that few could really pinpoint exactly how and why Hathahate had come to pass. After all, it hadnâ€™t always been this way. When Hathaway burst onto the scene in 2001 with a star-making debut in <i>The Princess Diaries</i>, the fanbase was positively adoring. Then came her graduation with <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> in 2005 and <i>The Devil Wears Prada </i>the following year, which secured her leading lady status. A few years later, <i>Rachel Getting Married</i> was heralded by the critics as her definitive coming-of-age moment, even scoring Hathaway her first Oscar nomination. Loved by the public and the box office alike, it seemed Hathaway could do no wrong.</p>
<p>As the noughties drew to a close, however, the tide was beginning to turn. Interestingly, Hathawayâ€™s first public misstep had nothing to do with her acting ability or movie roles, rather an ill-fated hosting gig at the Oscars in 2011 alongside James Franco. Despite Hathaway singing, dancing and changing outfits <i>eight</i> times that night in a bid to entertain, the critics were scathing. â€œIn what could go down as one of the worst Oscar telecasts in history, a bad and risky idea â€“ letting two actors host â€“ played out in spectacularly unwatchable fashion on the biggest of all nights for the film world,â€ <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/franco-bombs-at-oscars-makes-162234/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>Â Tim Goodman in <i>The Hollywood Reporter, </i>while<i> LA Weekly </i><a href="https://www.laweekly.com/oscars-2011-the-most-embarrassing-academy-awards-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">branded</a> the gig<i>Â </i>â€œthe most embarrassing Academy Awards everâ€.</p></p>

<p>Hathaway, for her part, tried to take the experience in her stride, admitting that her hosting had been â€œslightly manic and â€˜hyper-cheerleaderyâ€™ onscreenâ€. Franco, meanwhile, made no explanations for his performance, and even added fuel to the fire when he claimed that Hathaway was at least partially responsible for his criticism. â€œAnne Hathaway is so energetic, I think the Tasmanian Devil would look stoned standing next to Anne Hathaway,â€ he <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/style/anne-hathaway-responds-james-franco-205849/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> late-night host David Letterman in March 2011. Steadily, derision grew. In a now infamous diatribe against the actor in 2012, Alexis Rhiannon summed up all the hate against Hathaway on <i>Crushable</i>. â€œMy my, what a large beautiful mouth. I donâ€™t like it. Look at those dark beautiful eyes. I donâ€™t like them. Listen to her skinny beautiful words. I donâ€™t like them. Shut up. Shut up, Anne Hathaway.â€ That December, as hype grew around her performance in <i>Les MisÃ©rables</i>, the Hathahatred was about to erupt.

Come the Golden Globes at the beginning of the year, the Hathahaters found fresh ammunition when the actor accepted the award for Best Supporting Actress for <i>Les MisÃ©rables</i> with the words: â€œThank you for this lovely blunt object that I will forevermore use as a weapon against self-doubt.â€ Like clockwork, she was roundly accused of being too emotional, too saccharine, too contrived, too pretentious. Later that night, she was accused of of putting on â€œThe Anne Showâ€ after taking the microphone when <i>Les MisÃ©rables</i> won Best Musical or Comedy to thank people she forgot to mention in her acceptance speech earlier in the night.</p>
<p>Hathawayâ€™s win at the Screen Actors Guild Awards later that month also fed into the theory that her speeches were unforgivably annoying. While accepting her award for Best Supporting Actress, Hathaway was branded bizarre and inauthentic when she quipped about being thankful for having dental insurance, unlike her destitute character Fantine in <i>Les MisÃ©rables</i>, who resorts to selling her teeth for money. â€œLet me sum up why people hate Anne Hathaway,â€ <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/james-franco-howard-stern-discuss-why-people-hate-anne-hathaway-flna1c9084957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> radio host Howard Stern after Hathaway won her award. â€œFirst of all she gets a speechwriter to write her speech. Sheâ€™s overly dramatic at these award shows. Sheâ€™s always out of breath. Sheâ€™s even acting when sheâ€™s winning an award.â€</p>

<p>By the time the disastrous Oscars ceremony arrived just a few weeks later, Hathahatred reached its zenith. Despite winning the most prestigious award within the international film industry, Hathaway unleashed a new wave of loathing when she referenced the iconic song <i>I Dreamed A Dream</i> in her acceptance speech. For the first time, her career started to falter. â€œI had directors say to me, â€˜I think youâ€™re great. Youâ€™re perfect for this role, but I donâ€™t know how audiences will accept you because of all this stuff, this baggage,â€™â€ she told <i>Harperâ€™s Bazaar</i> in 2014. There was the emotional impact, too. In that same interview, she described how discovering the intense internet hatred after the Oscars felt like being â€œpunched in the gutâ€.Â

<p>Was Hathaway ever really so unlikeable? Of course not. For despite her catalogue of crimes, Hathahate was, ironically, never specifically about Anne Hathaway. Nowadays, as we reflect upon how the pervasive misogyny of the 2000s wronged so many of our female pop culture icons, itâ€™s clear that Hathaway was simply the victim of a long-held tradition; one in which a talented, beautiful, famous woman is used as a punching bag. Indeed, a <i>Buzzfeed</i> article <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/why-do-people-hate-anne-hathaway" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">titled</a> â€˜Why Do People Hate Anne Hathaway?â€™ appeared to unwittingly hit upon this when it highlighted, among many other scathing insights, that â€œmore often than not, thereâ€™s no real reasonâ€ for hating Anne Hathaway. The sentiment was echoed in a <i>New York Times</i> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/fashion/what-is-anne-hathaway-doing-wrong.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">piece</a> titled â€˜Do We Really Hate Anne Hathaway?â€™. â€œItâ€™s not really Anne Hathaway I â€˜hateâ€™,â€ said writer Sarah Nicole Prickett, who is quoted in the piece. â€œItâ€™s all the lesser, real-life Anne Hathaways I have known â€“ princessy, theatre-schooled girls who have no game and no sex appeal and eat raisins for dessert.â€</p>
<p class="stylist-youtube"><div class="iframely-card iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="Anne Hathaway Wins Best Supporting Actress: 85th Oscars (2013)" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/UplPbwr?maxheight=1200&app=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></p><p>But our story is far from over. In the wake of the Oscars furore, Hathaway disappeared from the spotlight. One might assume that she was too bruised to withstand any more mockery, but it seems that her retreat was a deliberate strategy to allow the pile-on to lose momentum and pivot elsewhere. We know this because Hathaway herself hinted that she was purposefully staying out of the public eye. When asked the reason for her absence in 2013 by the <i><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/anne-hathaway-sundance_n_4646239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huffington Post</a></i> at the Sundance Film Festival, she joked, rather brilliantly: â€œMy impression is that people needed a break from me.â€ In other words, she was playing the game and waiting for public approval to come full circle.Â 
	  </p>
<p>As much as staying under the radar was a smart move, Hathawayâ€™s re-emergence was genius. After taking a year out, she resurfaced in 2014 with a humdinger of a movie by way of Christopher Nolanâ€™s <i>Interstellar</i>, swiftly followed by earnest musical romance <i>Song One</i>, two roles which showed once more that she had serious range. She styled out talk show interviews with humour and honesty, joking about how her Oscars dress made her nipples look â€œerectâ€ on <i>The Tonight Show</i> and rapping about the Hathahaters during her next appearance. And she proved that she was bigger than the cyberbullies. â€œThis whole thing has made me a way more compassionate and loving person,â€ she told <i>Harperâ€™s Bazaar</i> in a triumphant interview. â€œAnd I donâ€™t feel sorry for myself.â€</p>

<p>By 2017, a flurry of think pieces about Hathaway returned to the media. But this time around, the pendulum had swung back in her favour. â€˜You Are Wrong And Also Dumb If You Hate Anne Hathaway,â€™ read one <a href="https://observer.com/2017/03/you-are-wrong-and-also-dumb-if-you-hate-anne-hathaway-colossal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">headline</a> from <i>Observer</i>. â€˜Itâ€™s Not Cool To Hate Anne Hathaway Anymore,â€™ <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/04/anne-hathaway-its-not-cool-to-hate-her-anymore.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared</a> <i>Vulture</i>. When 2018 rolled around, Hathawayâ€™s star turn as Hollywood It girl Daphne Kluger in <i>Oceanâ€™s 8</i> was hailed a resounding success. â€œFor a few years there, Hathawayâ€™s presence in Hollywood was attached to the narrative that she was trying too hard to be likeable, that she was embarrassing herself by showing her work,â€ <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/anne-hathaway-wins-oceans-8?mbid=synd_yahoo_rss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> Jia Tolentino in <i>The New Yorker</i>. â€œThis performance is a statement â€“ Hathaway understands the game sheâ€™s playing â€“ and a heist in itself. She runs away with the show.â€</p>
<p>More than a decade on from the age of peak Hathahate, the era when Hathaway was defined by public loathing now seems like a distant footnote. And yet, her story feels eerily relatable. A woman destined for the greatest heights of success, who instead found herself picked apart for her appearance, personality and talent: every woman is familiar with the narrative.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Hathawayâ€™s plan to wait out the hatred rather than attempt to win over the public worked, and these days sheâ€™s back at the top of her game and in the online graces. From chilling 1960s thriller <i>Motherâ€™s Instinct</i> to a BookTok-approved adaptation ofÂ Â <i>The Idea Of You</i>, things have come full circle.Â </p>
<p>Speaking to <i>Vanity Fair</i> as the magazineâ€™s April cover star, she reflected on the period of virulent derision: â€œA lot of people wouldnâ€™t give me roles because they were so concerned about how toxic my identity had become online.â€</p>
<p>â€œI had an angel in Christopher Nolan, who did not care about that and gave me one of the most beautiful roles Iâ€™ve had in one of the best films that Iâ€™ve been a part of,â€ she said. As a result of the two-time Academy Award-winning director hiring her, Hathaway added that â€œmy career did not lose momentum the way it could have if he hadnâ€™t backed meâ€.</p>
<p>One can only speculate, of course, whether Hathaway draws inspiration from her personal adversity for her professional roles. But the time for speculation is over. What we do know is that Hathaway is a supremely gifted actor, and that she deserves every good thing coming to her. Itâ€™s fortunate for us, too, that Hathaway knew the day would come when she would once again have her time in the sun. â€œYou have to remember in life that thereâ€™s a positive to every negative and a negative to every positive,â€ she told <i><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/anne-hathaway-at-oscars-jokes-about-my-acceptance-speeches-get-to-me-2013252/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US Weekly</a></i> in the wake of the Oscars backlash in 2013. â€œThings tip in the scale of the positive. So that is what I focus on.â€</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all have someone in our lives that weâ€™re not really sure about. It could be a colleague that is friendly towards you one day but gives you the cold shoulder the next. It might be an oldÂ <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">friend</a> who seems to be growing more and more irritated by your presence. Whoever they are, itâ€™s often hard to know how to act around them. Do you kill the person with kindness in the hope they change their behaviour? Or simply leave them to it and spend less time in their company?</p>
<p>These so-called ambivalent <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">relationships</a>Â may feel like theyâ€™re just part of adult life, but according to psychologist Adam Grant, theyâ€™re something we should be incredibly wary of, even more so than flat-out negative relationships.</p>
<p>â€œThe most intuitive reason is that ambivalent relationships are unpredictable,â€ Grant writes for <i>The New York Times</i>. â€œWith a clear enemy, you put up a shield when you cross paths. With a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/elizabeth-day-frenemies/777794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frenemy</a>, you never know whether Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde is going to show up.â€ </p>
<p>â€œI had assumed that with a neighbour or a colleague, having some positive interactions was better than all negative interactions,â€ he continues. â€œBut being cheered on by the same person who cuts you down doesnâ€™t buffer the bad feelings; it amplifies them.â€ </p>
<p>Indeed, studies have shown that a frenemy can cause you more distress than a straightforward enemy because these relationships are often so confusing that you never quite know what youâ€™re going to get. However, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10570314.2022.2146458" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> from earlier this year concluded that most of us maintain frenemyships because the benefits, such as saving face, maintaining social networks and sustaining important connections, outweigh the negative ramifications of dealing with the relationship or terminating it.</p>
<p>So if you are going to stay in contact with a frenemy, how should you go about it?</p>
<section class="pp-article__boxout">
<div id="boxout_1" class="pp-boxout" style="background-color:#606060;">

<h4>Studies have shown that a frenemy can cause you more distress than a straightforward enemyÂ </h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>Other than giving them a wide berth, if you must make contact with a frenemy, the key is setting clear and firm <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/types-of-boundaries/683749" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boundaries</a>. While you may not feel comfortable confronting someoneâ€™s passive aggression or snide comments, having good emotional boundaries can look like not taking on other peopleâ€™s emotional burdens (aka <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/trauma-dumping-friendship-psychology/583860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trauma dumping</a>) and not engaging in triggering topics.</p>
<p>When it comes to communication, being clear on what you deem acceptable is the best route to take. So if youâ€™re not ready to talk about something, dislike the tone youâ€™re being spoken to in or feel demeaned by name-calling or being dismissed, be explicit about your barriers.</p>
<p>While you canâ€™t guarantee they will react in kind, youâ€™ll know that youâ€™ve done everything you can to protect your wellbeing.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Between differentiating the strobe creams from dewy balms and the toners from the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/skincare-ahas-exfoliating-acids-for-skin-benefits-glycolic-salicylic-mandelic/181070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">liquid exfoliators</a>,Â beauty can be an overwhelming topic at times. There are so many brands out there, itâ€™s tricky to know where to start. But Beauty Pie is a great place to begin your journey.Â </p>
<p>The brand isnâ€™t a new concept. It launched back in 2017 and, along with the likes of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/brandon-truaxe-deciem-the-ordinary-tribute/246908" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deciem</a>, was part of a new wave of brands set to disrupt the beauty industry. Itâ€™s a service that gives members access to luxury cosmetics at factory prices â€“ and itâ€™s not too good to be true.</p>
<p>Beauty Pie is the brain child of entrepreneur Marcia Kilgore, whoâ€™s also the powerhouse behind iconic brands like Soap & Glory, Bliss Spa and FitFlop. Sheâ€™s worked in the industry for decades, and along the way she has learnt a lot about how both business and the beauty industry work.</p>
<p>Tired of the mark-up and overpriced products, Kilgoreâ€™s aim is to create more transparency when it comes to knowing what youâ€™re <i>actually </i>paying for, and she wants her customers to be able to buy luxury goods at cost price.Â 
	  </p>
<p>For example, a moisturiser from a well-known, high-end brand could have a retail cost of Â£100. But with Beauty Pie, a similar product will cost just Â£12.04 â€“ and the breakdown of that price is made clear on the website. Usually it will cover important things like product packaging, safety testing and warehousing. Itâ€™s also worth noting that Beauty Pie make absolutely no profit from any of the cosmetics they sell â€“ so what youâ€™re paying for is the price the factory has charged for it. All their profit comes from the cost of membership.</p>
<div class="iframely-instagram iframely-app iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="BEAUTY PIE on Instagram: &quot;FIRST EVER BEAUTY CANDY!  BEAUTY CANDIES are limited-quantity extreme deals, and when they&#039;re gone they&#039;re gone.

The Beauty Candy code will be delivered via SMS first thing tomorrow - if you&#039;re a member but not signed up for SMS alerts, please do so now! Just click the link in bio.   One tube per member.&quot;" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/uC3oa23?maxheight=1200&app=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Granted, thereâ€™s no unnecessary extra money spent on packaging, so the products are very no-frills (but Kilgore still demands everything should be made from recycled plastic where possible), and thereâ€™ll never be a celebrity face associated with the brand. But full transparency and an extensive,Â constantly expanding  range of hard-working, reliable products counts for much more, as does the precedent Beauty Pie is setting.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re slightly dubious of where these cosmetics are actually made and where they come from, donâ€™t be. Having worked in the industry for as long as she has, Kilgore has travelled the globe and knows exactly which factories in which countries are best for certain products. Plus, itâ€™s no secret that the majority of cosmetics tend to be made in the same places â€“ the very same places that Beauty Pie make their products.</p>

So weâ€™ve rounded up an edit of our favourite bits, to give you a helping handâ€¦</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before we begin, this isnâ€™t an article about the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/kate-middleton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Princess of Wales</a>, nor is this article about her private medical information. </p>
<p>Instead, this is a call to arms. Because, honestly, we need to unpick what has been going on with everyone but Princess Catherine over the last 10 weeks. </p>
<p>On Friday (22 March) the Princess of Wales released a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C402JKPtLVB/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video statement</a> revealing she has received a cancer diagnosis. This came after weeks of frenzied speculation by social media users and media outlets on the reason for her leave of absence from public duty. She described the diagnosis as a â€œhuge shockâ€, and said that her family have experienced â€œan incredibly tough couple of monthsâ€.</p>
<p>Following what quickly became a lesson in how we dehumanise those in the public eye (and how we find it all too easy to take our speculation to the faceless abyss of social media), an outpouring of shock and support flooded the online discourse. Commenters even began to retract their previous statements now her private matters no longer appeared gag-worthy material.</p>
<p>In one high-profile retraction, Blake Lively apologised on her Instagram Stories for previously making light of the Prince and Princess of Walesâ€™ doctored Motherâ€™s Day image, saying that a now-deleted post on her Betty Buzz business account â€œaround the â€˜Photoshop fails frenzyâ€™â€ has left her â€œmortifiedâ€ upon her learning of Princess Catherineâ€™s cancer diagnosis. Blake Lively wrote â€œIâ€™m sorryâ€, before adding â€œSending love and well wishes to all, alwaysâ€.</p>
<p>Having ranged from AI-generated images and body double allegations to â€˜blink twice if you need helpâ€™ â€˜jokesâ€™ and Kate-gate memes that spawned by the second, the rumour mill has now abruptly halted. </p>
<p>But before the news cycle moves on and those responsible write off their speculation as â€˜jokesâ€™ that just got out of hand, letâ€™s reflectÂ â€“ because this is a reminder that as a woman in 2024, the world (online and offline) is still a sinister place to exist.Â </p>
<div class="iframely-twitter iframely-app iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="The Prince and Princess of Wales on Twitter / X" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/xCBaJvH?maxheight=1200&maxwidth=1200&app=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2>The cosmetic procedure allegation</h2><p>When it was first announced in a statement that Kate would be stepping back from public duty for an unspecified period of time following a planned abdominal surgery in January, social media users commented in their droves to â€˜jokeâ€™ that the Princess may have been recuperating following cosmetic surgery. </p>
<p>From a â€˜BBLâ€™ to a â€˜tummy tuckâ€™, the procedures stacked up. Would this discourse have played out had it been the Prince on an absence of leave? The answer is no. </p>
<p>Such commentary is inherently misogynistic, with a pervading derogatory assumption that women reach a societally-prescribed milestone where cosmetic surgery must be on the table.Â </p>
<h2>The â€˜damsel in distressâ€™ narrative</h2><p>Other allegations that surfaced online included that the Princess of Wales must have been â€˜kidnappedâ€™, or that she was in a medically-induced coma. Both play into the harmfulÂ  â€˜damsel in distressâ€™ narrative trope, which has historically stripped women of power and control.</p>
<p>This kind of allegation also served to pressure a woman into giving up the last element of control she hadÂ â€“ the ability to choose when to tell the public of her cancer diagnosis. As Sarah Weinman writes in her essay for <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/kate-middleton-cancer-diagnosis-privacy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>The Cut</i></a>, â€œCancer is a wily beast, ready to strike on its own schedule, shattering the illusion of recovery and control. Is it any wonder, then, that Catherine wanted to hold on to it?â€.Â </p>
<h2>The mental health crisis</h2><p>After Piers Morgan speculated on whether Princess Catherine could have had a â€˜nervous breakdownâ€™ during TMZâ€™s controversial <i>Where is Kate Middleton?</i>Â documentary earlier this month, the rumour mill swirled with social media allegations that the Princess could be suffering a mental health crisis. </p>
<p>Morgan said, â€œI think the pressure on Kate has been utterly unbearable for a long time. It wouldnâ€™t shock me if she has had some kind of breakdown. Theyâ€™ve now had a major health crisis and sheâ€™s trying to bring up three young kids in a goldfish bowl of the Royal family. You put all that togetherÂ â€“ thatâ€™s a lot for any young woman to deal with.â€</p>
<p>Here, we see the inherently misogynistic trope of the â€˜hysterical womanâ€™Â â€“ an attempt to invalidate a womanâ€™s personal experiences, thoughts and feelings. In Morganâ€™s eyes, Princess Catherine would be the â€˜supporting roleâ€™ to Williamâ€™s â€˜Kingâ€™, and speculating that she may not be able to â€˜copeâ€™ with the idea of becoming Queen positions her as secondary to her husband.Â </p>
<h2>The body double speculation</h2><p>When Princess Catherine was spotted on a trip out to a local farm shop in Windsor on 16 March, weeks after the speculation surrounding her health began, a fresh wave of allegations surfaced online that a â€˜body doubleâ€™ must have been used. </p>
<p>This examination over grainy footage uncovers something a whole lot more sinister and is very reminiscent of a feeling any woman will understand: how society polices, politicises and scrutinises womenâ€™s bodies as we navigate the world. Such speculation can feel suffocating.</p>
<p>There have been, and continue to be, waves of commentary on how the media scrutinised Princess Diana, with harmful narratives and invasive paparazzo techniques. But back then, in the 90s, public speculation was confined to private conversation around the dinner table. </p>
<p>Now, we exist in an age where the noise of social media entirely eclipses that of the media, stripping a woman of her autonomy and privacy, so she feels she has to tell the world about an intensely private and personal medical diagnosis, perhaps before she is ready to. </p>
<p>Allegation by allegation, these individual moments of speculationÂ â€“ whether intended with humour or maliceÂ â€“ are moments of micro-misogyny that paint a vile portrait of how society continues to attack womanhood. </p>
<p>As Princess Catherine addressed the faceless camera to reveal her cancer diagnosis and put an end to the frenzied speculation of the last few weeks, she sat alone. She powerfully and bravely reclaimed her narrative after weeks of being hounded by misogyny. Letâ€™s hope she now gets the privacy she deserves to healÂ â€“ and that, as a society, we realise that words matter.Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2024, weâ€™re making sure our best skincare isnâ€™t just reserved for the face.</p>
<p>Our bodies need love too, and thereâ€™s a big trend towards â€˜<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/skincare/best-niacinamide-body-care-products/871463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">body care</a>â€™ at the moment, which takes everything we know about how to care for our faces and applies it to the rest of our skin as well. </p>
<p>After all, our skin doesnâ€™t just stop at the neck! So if youâ€™re interested in what peptides could do for your body, read onâ€¦</p>
<h2>What can peptide body care help with?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/dr_ifeoma_ejikeme/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Ifeoma Ejikeme</a>, a skin expert and medical director/founder of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/Adonia_Medical_Clinic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adonia Medical Clinic</a>, tells <i>Stylist</i>: â€œPeptides can help improve skin firmness and elasticity by promoting collagen synthesis, which is crucial for maintaining skin structure and resilience. Certain peptides, such as palmitoyl tripeptide-5, can help enhance skin hydration by supporting the skinâ€™s natural moisture barrier. And peptides like oligopeptide-34 may aid in reducing the appearance of dark spots and uneven skin tone by regulating melanin production.â€</p>
<h2>How long can it take for products containing peptides to work?</h2>
<p>Dr Ejikeme, who was commended in the Best Aesthetic Practitioner 2024 category at the Aesthetic Awards, says: â€œThe effectiveness of peptide-containing products can vary depending on factors such as the formulation, concentration of peptides, individual skin type and the specific concern being addressed. Generally, noticeable improvements may be observed within a few weeks to a couple of months of consistent use. However, for significant results, itâ€™s important to maintain a regular skincare routine and be patient as the skin undergoes its natural renewal process.â€</p>
<h2>What sorts of body care products should people look for that contain peptides?</h2>
<p>â€œWhen selecting skincare products containing peptides,â€ Dr Ejikeme says, â€œindividuals should look for formulations tailored to their specific skin concerns.â€Â </p>
<p>Some common products include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serums: â€œPeptide serums are lightweight and easily absorbable, making them suitable for targeting specific problem areas or layering beneath moisturisers.â€</li>
<li>Moisturisers: â€œPeptide-infused moisturisers offer hydration while delivering the benefits of peptides to the skinâ€™s surface, promoting overall skin health and resilience.â€</li>
</ul>

			<title><![CDATA[Why women want men to peel their oranges: the rise of acts of service as the prominent love language]]></title>
			<description>How did asking your partner to peel an orange for you become a barometer of affection, you ask? Social media, of course. Women filming themselves applying â€œorange peel theoryâ€ on their unsuspecting other halves speaks to a generational love language, argues executive editor Jazmin Kopotsha. Here, she speaks to the author and originator of &lt;i&gt;The 5 Love Languages&lt;/i&gt; to uncover why women are crying out for acts of service (and what those actions look like in real life).</description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My boyfriend has peeled an orange for me. We were ranking our favourite fruit (thrilling, I know) and I declared that oranges were overrated. They require too much work to get in to. Those awful white stringy veins? Gag material. And you can never really tell how ripe theyâ€™re going to be until youâ€™re covered in pulp and itâ€™s all too late.</p>
<p>A few days later, he presented me with a pre-peeled segment of orange to eat. Iâ€™m convinced this was an expression of disbelief at my aversion to oranges more than anything, but I was touched by the gesture all the same. </p>
<p>This Very Important Milestone in our relationship happened ages ago. But when â€œorange peel theoryâ€ swept TikTok recently â€“ videos of women asking their partners to peel an orange for them to see if they would take on the task as confirmation of their love â€“ I couldnâ€™t help but tune in. I told myself this was out of ironic fascination, of course. And that I, a serious grown-up in a secure and loving <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">relationship</a>, was above benchmarking whether my partner was worth keeping against this arbitrary social media trend. Insert knowing raised eyebrow emoji here.Â </p>
<p>My hubris didnâ€™t last long. I was quickly shot down when I told a friend about my relationship already meeting this cool-girl criteria. Contrary to the women testing their partnerâ€™s affection with a request to skin some citrus on camera, my boyfriend did it for me ages ago. Talk about <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/dating-love/how-to-find-love/762209" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">true love</a>. She told me it didnâ€™t count because I neither wanted nor asked for the peeled orange so it was never really for my benefit. Humbled by a rollercoaster of smugness and insecurity, I forced myself to sit with the scenario for a while. Yes, online trends like these often have an unsavoury habit of over-simplifying things that are nuanced and complex â€“ especially in the wellbeing space â€“ but at the heart of this relatively harmless game of â€œwhat would your partner do for youâ€, there seemed to be a shift in mindset, too. </p>
<p>A wave of women had overwhelmed social media with a refreshed framework for a â€˜goodâ€™ partner. Gone were the #RelationshipGoals that plagued the 2010s with images of women surrounded by lavish presents, flash-mob proposals and perfectly framed photos taken by their patient Instagram boyfriends. Consider this the era in which the â€˜receiving giftsâ€™ <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/relationships/love-language-dating-deal-breakers/737951" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">love language</a> thrived in public.Â </p>

<p>Take it back a few years and you might remember that the climax of most romcoms of the 90s and 00s was when a man finally articulated his feelings to the flummoxed yet doting female lead. Think, Heath Ledgerâ€™s character serenading Julia Styles with <i>Canâ€™t Take My Eyes Off You</i> in <i>10 Things I Hate About You</i>. Tom Cruiseâ€™s â€œI love you; you complete meâ€ in <i>Jerry McGuire</i>. Any mention of that painful trope that includes â€œthose three little words sheâ€™s always wanted to hearâ€.Â  Consider this the glory years for the â€˜words of affirmationâ€™ love language, as demonstrated by all those films in which the guyâ€™s wrongdoings are undone by shouting (or singing) his feelings. </p>
<p>No doubt â€˜quality timeâ€™ and â€˜physical touchâ€™ have peaked and troughed in our lifetimes, too. The former perhaps in the post-war period of being reunited with a loved one or even after the internet fundamentally altered the way we communicate with each other. And we need not look too far to find womenâ€™s yearning for physical touch, magnified for all of us by the Covid lockdown years. I canâ€™t be the only one who read far too much into an accidental brush of the hand at the supermarket after being starved of skin-to-skin contact.Â Â </p>

<h4>Acts of service is 2024â€™s love language of choice</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>Looking at our behaviour right now, though, it seems that acts of service is the love language of choice for women in 2024. We want partners who are willing to do the quieter things that make our lives that little bit easier. Millennial women in particular are frazzled, tired and overstimulated. Surely the last thing any of us want to do isâ€¦ well, anything. <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/the-great-resignation-women/602013" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Great Resignation</a> that saw swarms of us quitting our jobs (without necessarily having something else to go to), the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/career-advice-rejecting-girlboss-culture/642638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decline of Girl Boss hustle culture</a> and the seductive appeal of living a #SoftLife have been hinting as such over the last couple of years.Â 
	  </p>
<p>For me, I crave my boyfriendâ€™s interjection in day-to-day decision-making. Plan the date night. Decide what TV show weâ€™re watching. Do a load of laundry so that my go-to jumpsuit is clean for the meeting I told you Iâ€™m going to. And message my friends to cancel on my behalf because Iâ€™m too tired/canâ€™t be bothered/could do with some time to myself.Â </p>
<p>Is it too much to ask? I donâ€™t think so. Though bearing the brunt of the emotional labour has long been the plight of womenkind, I wonder if weâ€™ve reached our limit and so attach new value to a partner willing to carry some of that load out of love rather than obligation. One of my friends told me how it melted her heart to find that her husband had got up early to make breakfast, fill up the car with petrol and lay out her bag ahead of her first day in a new job. On the flip side, the most common complaint from another close friend is along the lines of: â€œWhy do I have to ask him to do everything? Why canâ€™t he see what needs doing and just do it for me?â€</p>
<p>I wouldnâ€™t go so far as to eliminate the role other love languages play in modern womenâ€™s desires: sex is great, gifts are cute and, of course, Iâ€™d like to spend some time with you. But I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything more attractive than a man who can sense your needs, expect nothing in return and utters those three magic words: â€œIâ€™ll handle it.â€Â </p>

<p>The man whoâ€™s dedicated his lifeâ€™s work to understanding how people truly want to be loved is Dr Gary Chapman. In his early years as a marriage counsellor, he noticed that couples would often voice similar complaints in their sessions. To unpick what people really meant when they said they didnâ€™t feel loved, he scoured through over a decadeâ€™s worth of notes for the answer. </p>
<p>â€œRemarkably, I found their answers fell into five categories,â€ Dr Chapman tells <i>Stylist</i>. â€œThe premise is simple: different people with different personalities express love in different ways. These ways of expressing and receiving love are called â€˜love languagesâ€™ and every individual has one they prefer above the others. I refer to it as their primary love language.â€Â </p>
<p>Itâ€™s now been more than 30 years since Dr Chapmanâ€™s book <i><a href="https://5lovelanguages.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 5 Love Languages: The Secret To Love That Lasts</a>,</i> hit bestseller lists across the world and the prevalence of his concept in how we understand relationship behaviours is showing no sign of slowing down. Since the book was released, the five methods of loving â€“ receiving gifts, quality time, words of affirmation, physical touch and acts of service â€“ have given relationship counsellors and psychologists a blueprint to use as they guide clients through a whole manner of things.Â </p>

<h4>Acts of service help to alleviate womenâ€™s stress</h4>
<p>Dr Gary Chapman, author of The 5 Love Languages</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>When I asked Dr Chapman about my hunch that women are more vocally seeking acts of service in a romantic partner, he suggested that it could be related to longstanding cultural and societal pressures that have slowly started to shift over generations. â€œI believe women today feel freer to express their need for help. In the past, they were expected to do it all and do it well,â€ he explains. â€œI think women are speaking up and asking for the help they need to create a healthy work/life balance, and offering acts of service is a way to help alleviate their stress.â€ </p>
<p>Dr Chapman caveats this thought with the fact that he hasnâ€™t noticed that one love language resonates more than the other four. â€œThe love languages are rather evenly distributed from 23% to 18% in each category,â€ he says. One is not necessarily more common among males and another among females. But <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BACP registered</a> psychotherapist and anxiety expert Kamalyn Kaur offers a similar observation on women being more vocal â€“ at least on the internet â€“ about wanting acts of service from their partners.</p>
<p>â€œHistorically and traditionally, women have often been responsible for managing households, taking care of the family and child-rearing responsibilities,â€ Kaur explains. â€œAlthough this is changing, I think the expectations can still be there, putting a lot of pressure on women, particularly those who are also managing careers. In some cultures, women are still expected to take on the role of â€˜running the houseâ€™ without the men being involved at all.Â </p>
<p>â€œGiven these circumstances, it is no surprise that an act of service will be more appreciated and valuable than someone buying you a bunch of flowers or giving you words of affirmation. An act of service will take the load off you, alleviate some pressure and will also make you feel both seen and supported.â€</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Being able to ease the burden of responsibilities weighing on an acts of service person will speak volumes, Dr Chapman explains. â€œLaziness, broken commitments and making more work for them tell speakers of this language their feelings donâ€™t matter. When someone serves out of love (and not obligation), an acts of service person feels truly valued and loved.â€</p>
<p>Itâ€™d be remiss not to acknowledge that to feel catered to as someone whose love language is acts of service relies on knowing what that looks like for you. Granted, I didnâ€™t ask for the slice of orange my boyfriend presented me after I told him I didnâ€™t like the effort of eating oranges. But facilitating something for me â€“ even if it is eating a piece of fruit that I donâ€™t really want â€“ is a demonstratable type of love that I value very highly. </p>
<p>â€œThe love languages are an intuitive and simple way to teach couples how to tune into each otherâ€™s ways of expressing love,â€ Dr Chapman says. What might that look like in practice? We asked 13 women to tell us.Â Â </p>
<h2>Speaking in Love Languages: the acts of service that make women in relationships feel lovedÂ </h2><h3>â€œI recognise itâ€™s not sexy or cool, but thatâ€™s the reality of love as an adultâ€</h3>
<p><b>Ellen, 31, lives with her boyfriend. Theyâ€™ve been together for seven years.</b></p>
<p>â€œI have many expectations around general admin and house upkeep, and I find that when those expectations arenâ€™t met I can feel my love meter draining. One is that I have a special container for our toothbrushes, and I expect that my partner will put their toothbrush in this container rather than leaving it on the side of the sink, where itâ€™ll create a little toothpaste ring. We take turns to cook for the week, and on a Sunday evening, I expect him to clean the kitchen and clear the fridge so I can start my cooking week with ease. When he doesnâ€™t do these things, Iâ€™m resentful and grumpy. When he does, I feel such immense love for him â€“ itâ€™s wild.</p>
<p>â€œSimilarly, he recently took care of the admin of researching Airbnbs and booking flights for an upcoming wedding. I loved that. It was like he recognised that I was busy and stressed out, and knew that the mental load of having to do that would be weighing on me. Each time he collects my antidepressant prescription from Boots so I donâ€™t have to, or arranges condiments in the fridge, thatâ€™s better than any bouquet of flowers. My love language is 100% â€˜making my life easierâ€™, which I recognise is not remotely sexy or cool, but thatâ€™s the reality of love as an adult.â€</p>

<p>â€œAs soon as we put a film on, Iâ€™m guilty of falling asleep straight away, even when I say Iâ€™m not tired. This happened a few times when we started living together, and my boyfriend would always be frustrated and confused by me avoiding getting up and putting myself to bed â€“ sometimes you just canâ€™t be bothered. So now, heâ€™ll let me fall asleep and carry me up to bed at the end of the film.â€Â </p>

<p><b>Annie, 32, lives with her boyfriend. Theyâ€™ve been together for 10 years.</b></p>
<p>â€œI donâ€™t necessarily expect it (and I have never asked), but for some reason, if weâ€™re walking the dog together, he will <i>always</i> pick up the dogâ€™s poo. I can be holding her lead and heâ€™ll hold out his hand for the bags. Or if heâ€™s got her, heâ€™ll pass her over to me so that he can pick it up. I donâ€™t know when it started but it always makes me laugh, and now itâ€™s just imbedded in the routine that itâ€™s something I donâ€™t do. And just to clarify: if itâ€™s just me walking her, I do still pick it up!â€</p>
</p>
<h3>â€œHe bought me some nice treats after a date. I would have preferred him to offer to walk me homeâ€ </h3>
<p><b>Sue, 26, is single and dating. </b></p>
<p>â€œI was dating a really nice guy for a while, but something just wasnâ€™t clicking. I could tell he liked me a lot (he told me so enough) but it just wasnâ€™t hitting right. I remember talking to my mum about how I felt bad for breaking up with him when he spent so much money on gifts. She said the only thing I would consistently complain about would be the fact that he never offered to help me get home after a date â€“ whether waiting for a taxi or walking me home. In hindsight, that says a lot about both of us.â€Â Â </p>

<h4>â€œIf he goes to the shop, I expect a little treatâ€</h4>
<p>Jess, 30</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p><b>Jess, 30, has been with her partner for six years.</b></p>
<p>â€œMy feet are always cold, so every night when I get into bed he lets me put mine on his to warm them up. If I go out in the evening, he walks me to the station. He also always cleans the catâ€™s litter tray because he knows that makes me gag. Expectation-wise: if he ever goes to the shop I expect him to pick me up a little treat. Non-negotiable, in my opinion.â€</p>
<h3>â€œMy husband rubs my belly and sings a songâ€</h3>
<p><b>Miranda, 33, is married. </b></p>
<p>â€œWhen Iâ€™m on my period, my husband rubs my belly and sings a song called <i>Bleedy Magoo</i>â€¦ and now, I donâ€™t think I could get through the week without that ritual. Also, he <i>always</i> does the washing up and changes our bed sheets every Friday â€“ and changing bed sheets is lowkey the worst chore.â€</p>
</p>
<h3>â€œI expect to be escorted home or for him to at least find and track my journeyâ€</h3>
<p><b>Jazmin, 31, lives with a partner of four years.</b></p>
<p>â€œThe last thing I want to do when Iâ€™m stressed is have to think about little matters of convenience. For example, if thereâ€™s a train strike and my boyfriend knows Iâ€™m in the office, then I want him to check that Iâ€™ll be able to get home OK, have a look at my options and come to meet me if Iâ€™m going to arrive late at night.Â </p>
<p>â€œIf Iâ€™m out late and getting a train home, I expect to be escorted from the train station. Also, weâ€™ve both learned that I will not engage in conversation in the morning until Iâ€™ve been brought a cup of tea in bed. Separate from these sorts of things, Iâ€™ve definitely noticed that the markers of a â€˜grown-upâ€™ relationship are not just traditional affection. Itâ€™s making the other person feel heard and respected, which for me requires taking things off my plate to help me focus on other things.â€  </p>

<h4>Heâ€™s been known to wash my hair for me</h4>
<p>Louise, 33</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p><b>Louise, 33, has been with her partner for seven years.</b></p>
<p>â€œThere have been a few times in recent years when my boyfriend has been known to wash my hair for me. It started almost as a joke because I was moaning about how long my washday routine takes. He half-assed offered to do it for me, and I donâ€™t think he expected me to say yes. But every couple of months, particularly if Iâ€™ve been having a rough time, heâ€™ll run me a bath and offer to wash and condition my hair while I soak.â€Â </p>
<h3>â€œMy husband heats the car before I get inâ€</h3>
<p><b>Vicky, 30, is married and theyâ€™ve been together for five years.  </b></p>
<p>â€œWhen itâ€™s cold out, my husband puts the heating on in our car remotely so when I get in itâ€™s already warm. We have a ritual every Sunday: my husband gets up first and makes us both a coffee and then gets back into bed, where we listen to the radio and do a crossword (weâ€™re horribly old for our age).</p>
<p>â€œWhen we go to nice restaurants, my husband always picks the wine, and for me, this is an act of service. He is really into wine (and very knowledgeable) and he always picks something he knows Iâ€™ll love, that goes with what Iâ€™m eating, how Iâ€™m feeling that day and what the weatherâ€™s like. It sounds ridiculous, but I find it very romantic.â€</p>
</p>
<h3>â€œI donâ€™t have to worry about where Iâ€™ve put my keysâ€</h3>
<p><b>Alexis, 37, has been dating her boyfriend for two years.</b></p>
<p>â€œOne of the things that puts the biggest smile on my face recently is when Iâ€™m rushing to get out of the door in the morning and looking around for my keys, Iâ€™ll eventually find them on the shelf by the door. I always forget to put them there (in my own house!) and often throw them on a table or leave them tucked down the side of a sofa. But heâ€™s noticed that I tend to struggle with mornings and beat myself up when I slow myself down/forget things. Now heâ€™s taken to putting my keys by the door whenever he stumbles across them.â€</p>

<h4>A song and dance has to be made about my birthday</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p><b>Amy, 26, is engaged.Â </b></p>
<p>â€œI like my fiance to always walk on the outside of the pavement so I can walk on the inside (lower risk of a passing car driving through a puddle and splashing me, running me over, etc).  Iâ€™m also very big on birthdays â€“ I couldnâ€™t care less if we donâ€™t celebrate Valentineâ€™s Day or anniversaries, but a partner <i>has to</i> make a song and dance about my birthday.  (Iâ€™m such an only child.)â€Â </p>
<h3>â€œHe looks at the map so I donâ€™t have toâ€</h3>
<p><b>Rebecca, 32, has been with her partner for just over a year.</b></p>
<p>â€œMy partner drives me and my daughter on the school run twice a week. Plus, when we go anywhere he looks at the map and gets the route in his head first so I can just follow him and not have to look at my phone. This is love.â€</p>
<h3>â€œHe has to sleep on the side of the bed closest to the doorâ€</h3>
<p><b>Sophie, 30, lives with her boyfriend. Theyâ€™ve been together for nine years.</b></p>
<p>â€œWhen Iâ€™m really busy, working late or generally feeling like my to-do list is never-ending, my partner is so great at knowing when to ramp up all the little acts of service that make my day better and less stressful. He will stroke my arm for ages to calm me down (weird but nice), heâ€™ll make my favourite dinner (usually loads of carbs) and run to the shop and get me my favourite Yorkie raisin and biscuit chocolate and bring it to me with a cup of tea. Heâ€™ll also watch reality TV with me, includingÂ <i>Married At First Sight: Australia</i> even though he hates it because I like having someone to talk to about it.</p>
<p>â€œAlso, I donâ€™t like sleeping near the door. I always sleep next to the window and he always sleeps closest to the door. So, whenever we go away anywhere he will automatically choose the side closest to the door (so he gets murdered first, obviously, while I have time to escape out the window).â€</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you had just won gold at an international indoors athletic competition or taken home a silver medal for your country at a swimming event, youâ€™d expect to be paid handsomely, right? But that isnâ€™t the case for many of our best sportswomen. In fact, the majority are barely scraping a living â€“ despite being at the very top of their field.  </p>
<p>Thatâ€™s according to the results of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/68534081" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the BBCâ€™s 2024 Elite British Sportswomenâ€™s Study</a>, which saw 615 elite sportswomen across 28 different sports asked to fill in a survey about their experiences. Of the 143 women who responded, only 93 were full-time athletes and 13 received absolutely zero income for being at the top of their field.  </p>
<p>And although some athletes in high-profile sports like football and tennis may receive lucrative sponsorship opportunities, this study shows thatâ€™s not the case across the board. In fact, more than three-quarters of the respondents said they earned less than Â£30,000 a year from their sport, while four in 10 said they earned less than Â£10,000 a year (including grants, funding, prize money, salaries or sponsorship).Â </p>
<p>And that lack of money is clearly taking its toll: more than a third of respondents said theyâ€™d considered giving up their sport due to the recent cost of living crisis and the majority answered â€˜noâ€™ when asked whether sportswomen were paid enough and received enough financial reward compared to their male counterparts. </p>
<p>Sponsorship opportunities were a big issue among respondents, who said the current economic climate made it hard to get sponsorship, even though men seemed to get more. Indeed, one respondent added: â€œAs much as the profile of womenâ€™s sport is on the rise, in the smaller sports, sponsorship is decreasing and making it harder to survive, even with world-class results and world top-10 rankings.â€ </p>
<p>The study also found that more than a third of respondents had been trolled on social media, while almost three-quarters of respondents had experienced sexism in their sport. One in three respondents said they did not feel supported by their club or governing body to have a baby and continue to compete at their current level.Â </p>

<h4>Four in 10 said they earned less than Â£10,000 a year</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>Thatâ€™s even more shocking when you consider that, <a href="https://www.womenssporttrust.com/latest-research-from-womens-sport-trust-delves-into-visibility-and-fandom-of-womens-sport-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to research the Womenâ€™s Sports Trust</a>, more people than ever before turned up to watch womenâ€™s sport live in the UK last year. The same can be said for viewership figures, with a record-breaking 46.7 million people tuning in to watch womenâ€™s sport on linear TV in 2023. </p>
<p>Womenâ€™s sport does feel more visible than ever â€“ and itâ€™s inspiring more and more young girls to take part. But clearly, the fight for equality is far from over.  </p>
<p>While itâ€™s amazing to see so much progress being made when it comes to crowd sizes and viewership figures, this survey is a poignant reminder of the battles sportswomen are fighting behind the scenes just to compete on the world stage. </p>
<p>In 2024, itâ€™s not good enough that women with so much talent are being forced to consider giving up their sport simply because they canâ€™t make ends meet. <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/womens-world-cup-2023-record-ticket-sales/805153" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The excitement surrounding last yearâ€™s Womenâ€™s Fifa World Cup</a> was a prime example of just how powerful and exciting womenâ€™s sport can be. We just need more brands to get on board and give more sportswomen the opportunities and financial security they deserve so they can turn their full attention towards the sports they love.Â </p></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When youâ€™re trying to conceive, the advice tends to centre around what you eat, how often you have sex and keeping stress to a minimum. But regular movement is also a key lifestyle factor that can influence how you feel â€“ physically, emotionally and mentally â€“ on your pregnancy journey. The ideal activity is one that strengthens the core and pelvic floor (youâ€™ll need that later down the line!), improves posture (crucial if your centre of gravity starts to shift as a bump grows) and calms the mind. And thatâ€™s where pilates comes in. </p>
<p>We know that pilates offers a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/reformer-pilates-without-bed-machine/839182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">host of benefits</a> for everyone, regardless of age, gender or reproductive intentions. But the mat (or reformer)-based activity is especially useful for pregnant women and those thinking of starting a family. Itâ€™s not that the exercise will help you to get pregnant (thatâ€™s stretching the powers of pilates a little <i>too</i> far), but itâ€™s about prepping the body to cope with the physical (and mental) changes that happen quite quickly once you are pregnant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of it a little like a pre-season; if you were looking at a nine-month football stretch, youâ€™d spend a few months before doing lots of strength and conditioning and mobility workouts to prepare ahead of all those games. That pre-season might not win you the trophy, but itâ€™ll put you in a great position from that first match.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://pilatespt.co.uk/ppt_team/hollie-grant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollie Grant</a> is an award winning reformer and mat pilates instructor, and founder of Pilates PT. In her new book, <i><a href="https://thebumpplan.com/ttc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bump Plan</a></i>, she explains that the trying to conceive (TTC) stage is often sugar-coated as being an exciting time full of â€œfun and lots of shaggingâ€, but thatâ€™s not always that way for many women. â€œFor me, this was the time where I really â€˜neededâ€™ exercise,â€ she explains. â€œI leaned heavily on it to support my mental health and mood while navigating TTC and found it to be an anchor.â€  </p>
<p>During her first pregnancy, she struggled with urinary stress incontinence (ie leaking when you jump or cough), and as such, Grant writes that when TTC with her second baby, she wanted to meet the physical demands of pregnancy from the off. â€œI wanted to enter my next pregnancy feeling strong, capable and with a seriously functional pelvic floor,â€ she says.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why is exercise like pilates important when TTC?Â </h2><p>The NHS recommends that the average, non-pregnant adult do 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise a week, but there are no guidelines for women TTC. There are umpteen reasons for that, says Grant, including the fact that some people donâ€™t know theyâ€™re pregnant for some time and the fact that the TTC community isnâ€™t seen as a distinct group of people (at least within these mainstream bodies). That means youâ€™ve got to decide how to see yourself â€“ as part of the general adult population or the pregnant population.</p>
<p>Grant explains that the only real difference between the two is the recommended intensity of cardio exercise. Moderate intensity is recommended during pregnancy, while the general population can work at moderate, vigorous or very vigorous intensity. If youâ€™re actively trying for a baby, you may want to lean more towards that 150 minute-moderate intensity goal â€“ which also includes two strength workouts a week.</p>

</figure>
<p>The key thing to remember about pregnancy is that babies grow in the abdominal cavity, so having a strong, functional core is important for protecting the spine and pelvic floor. Grant explains that TTC is the perfect time to do as much ab work as possible â€“ especially as core work becomes more challenging once a bump comes into play. Cardio is also important as your blood volume doubles during pregnancy, and all that extra liquid needs to be pumped around the body by the cardiovascular system. So nowâ€™s the perfect time to set up a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/benefits-of-swimming-learning-to-swim-confidence/566069" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swimming routine</a> or do <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/couch-to-5k-30-minutes-unrealistic-goal/843069" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">couch to 5K</a>, while committing to regular pilates sessions thatâ€™ll strengthen those key areas.Â </p>
<p>With that in mind, here are the 5 pilates moves that Grant recommends practicing if youâ€™re TTC.Â Â </p>
<h2>5 pilates moves for people trying to conceiveÂ </h2><h3>Arm reach </h3>
<p>â€œThis is a great exercise for teaching spine stability,â€ says Grant. â€œDuring pregnancy, our growing uterus can pull the pelvis forward at the front and cause us to lean backwards.â€ Thatâ€™s more pronounced if the abs stretch and struggle to support the spine. Arm reaches are all about promoting core activation, which then stabilises the spin and reduces the temptation to lean back.  </p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Breathe in, arms by your side</li>
<li>As you exhale, reach your arms up over your head and hold them there for a moment </li>
<li>Stay in a neutral position (donâ€™t lean back)*, then inhale and lower the arms back down </li>
<li>Repeat </li>
</ol>
<p><i>*that neutral position is key for making the abs at the front work harder.</i></p>
<h3>Hip hinges&nbsp;</h3>
<p>â€œIâ€™d prescribe these exercises to every human being if I could. Hip hinges activate the hamstrings and glutes which, given our modern-day sedentary lifestyles, can become weak and lazy,â€ she explains. â€œDuring pregnancy, itâ€™s these muscles that give the pelvis support as the uterus grows.â€ This movement pattern is known as the good morning stretch in strength training and is the same pattern as a deadlift (were you to add weights). </p>
<ol>
<li>Find your neutral standing position and then bring your arms to prayer at your chest </li>
<li>Make sure your knees are soft and then when youâ€™re ready, imagine that you are bowing </li>
<li>Push your bum back and hinge at the hips until you can feel the backs of your legs stretch but canâ€™t go any further without bending your knees or back </li>
<li>Hold </li>
<li>As you exhale, bring yourself back up to standing and repeat&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="StrongIn10v2_GoodMorning_Emma" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/q3OduhT?maxheight=1200" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media *"></iframe></div></div><h3>Hip lift </h3>
<p>Grant says: â€œToo much sitting down in our modern lifestyles can leave our hip flexors feeling tight and weak. Thatâ€™s a problem because, in pregnancy, we need strong and flexible hip flexors that can support our pelvis. This exercise targets the concentric (shortening) phase and eccentric (lengthening) phase of muscle activation and helps improve the function of the hip flexor.â€ </p>
<ol>
<li>Stand in a natural position </li>
<li>Shift your weight to your right leg (knees soft) and bring your hands to prayer </li>
<li>Exhale to bend your left knee and lift it so that your left thigh is parallel to your hip (think: standing tabletop) </li>
<li>Hold, balancing on the right leg </li>
<li>Inhale as you lower the left foot to tap the floor and exhale to bring it back up to that tabletop position </li>
<li>Repeat, making sure that the pelvis remains fixed in place â€“ it should only be the left leg moving in the hip socket. Nothing else should move </li>
<li>Change legs and repeat on the other side</li>
</ol>
<h3>Quad stretch</h3>
<p>â€œThis is a great exercise for learning how to stabilise the pelvis, and it also works the glutes and abdominals. Pelvic stability is really helpful as the bump grows, so strengthening the pelvic stabilisers (our pelvic floor and transverse abdominis) will make a huge difference ahead of pregnancy.â€ </p>
<ol>
<li>Come into a standing kneel (only your legs should be on the floor â€“ not your bum too) </li>
<li>Engage the core and bring your arms up to shoulder height, relaxing the shoulders away from your ears </li>
<li>Imagine a line going from the crown of your head to your knees </li>
<li>As you inhale, slowly start to hinge backwards â€“ maintaining that imaginary line </li>
<li>As we exhale, bring yourself back to the start position </li>
<li>You should feel the effort in the core and, if youâ€™re squeezing, the glutes </li>
</ol>
<h3>Side kneeling leg lift </h3>
<p>Grant calls this exercise â€˜spicyâ€™, so you can be sure of a good hip abductor burn. â€œLift the leg as high as you can without making the rest of the body move.â€ </p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Come to a standing kneel and find that neutral position, arms out to the side </li>
<li>Lean towards your left side so that you can put your left hand on the floor </li>
<li>As you come down, extend the right leg along the mat, making sure the hips are facing forward </li>
<li>Bring your right arm towards the ceiling, exhale and slowly lift your right leg up towards the ceiling â€“ toes pointed </li>
<li>Inhale and, with control, bring that right leg back down </li>
<li>Repeat a few times before switching sidesÂ </li>
</ol>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>April is upon us and so is <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/astrology/mercury-retrograde-survival-guide/781097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mercury retrograde</a>, which starts on the 1st of April and doesnâ€™t budge until the 24th. That spells troubleâ€¦ but what else can your <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/star-signs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">star sign</a> expect this month? And how can you best navigate Mercury retrogradeâ€™s classic problems with communication, travel and technology? Your horoscope is here to help.Â </p>
<p>Youâ€™ll find your star signâ€™s specific forecast ahead, but first letâ€™s run through whatâ€™s happening in the world of astrology for the month. First, as mentioned, itâ€™s Mercury retrograde. Then, on the 5th, weâ€™re hit with two major transits: the sun conjoining with the North Node in Aries, which will up our motivation, and Venus entering Aries, which will nudge us to turn our dreams into plans.Â </p>
<p>On 8 April we have another double dose of intense transits, probably the most intense of 2024. Not only will we have a total solar eclipse in Aries, but the only aspect it will be making is an exact conjunction to Chiron. Talk about intense, in-your-face healing. Solar eclipses are all about huge new beginnings that can totally turn us upside down. This one in particular will bring us new beginnings by challenging our motivationsÂ â€“ are we doing what we <i>want </i>to do and following our passions? Take it easy this week, these are tough questions. The Mercury cazimi in Aries on the 11th will bring some clarity, thankfully.</p>
<p>The sun enters Taurus on 19 April, which will push us to focus on practical stability and security. Change will be all around, so doing what you can to stay steady will be key. Keep that energy for another transit on the 21st: Jupiter conjoining Uranus. After that, things should settle down.Â </p>
<p>On the 23rd, the full moon in Scorpio will prompt us to dig into our emotions and then, finally, Mercury will station direct. Phew. On the 29th, Venus enters Taurus, which will make us assess our deep desiresÂ â€“ and prompt us to let go of any weâ€™ve outgrown. Finally, Mars enters its home in Aries on 30 April. This is a great moment to hit the ground running, using all the plans youâ€™ve been working away on. Everything you learn this month is going to come in handy.Â </p>
<p>Ready to dig in to the specifics for your star sign? Read on for your horoscope for April.Â </p>
<h2>Aries</h2><p><i>21 March to 19 April<br />
	  </i></p>
<p>You have a lot going on in April, Aries, and you have an opportunity to transform and rise like the phoenix. This wonâ€™t come easy, but who else can do it other than the warrior of the zodiac? Especially during your solar returnÂ â€“ happy birthday, April Aries! Watch out for Mercury Retrograde, which will cause trouble with communication and your day-to-day routine. Youâ€™ll feel an urge to kick up a fuss, but itâ€™s important to reframe: issues might not be your fault, but what can you do to make them better? If you lean into this way of thinking, youâ€™ll see success this month.Â </p>
<p>On 8 April there will be a solar eclipse in your sign, which signals big changes in your life for the next year. On the day, take it easy. This eclipse will be heavy, energy-wise, so this is a time to reflect, let go and rest. Afterwards, prepare for a season of unexpected shifts and opportunitiesÂ â€“ donâ€™t let them pass you by.Â </p>
<h2>Taurus</h2><p><i>20 April to 20 May<br />
	  </i></p>
<p>Throughout April, youâ€™ll feel a pull to read between the lines and understand the unspoken words. Youâ€™re an investigative mood, and thatâ€™s fine, but make sure you donâ€™t become <i>too</i> watchful. Sometimes itâ€™s worth trusting your intuition and just going for it, rather than digging into every minor interaction.Â </p>
<p>On the 19th, Taurus season beginsÂ â€“ happy birthday, Taurus! You might experience some uncomfortable adjustments in the realm of work this month. Although frustrating, this will bring growth. Face the changes head-on and make tweaks where necessary.Â </p>
<p>Towards the end of the month, youâ€™ll be looking more deeply into your relationships. Somethingâ€™s not working and youâ€™re ready to let it go. Turn towards self-love at this time.Â </p>
<h2>Gemini</h2><p><i>21 May to 20 June<br />
	  </i></p>
<p>Misunderstandings abound this month and youâ€™ll be dealing with the emotional hangover. Consider how you might have played a part in some of these miscommunicationsâ€¦ have you unintentionally said something hurtful? Focus on this and consider the other personâ€™s feelings when you move towards patching things up.Â </p>
<p>April will also be a good month to resolve any internal roadblocks for your long-term goals. Is there a reason you arenâ€™t going after your dreams? Are you scared of failure? Or even success? Make it a priority to reflect on your aspirations and whatâ€™s been holding you back in the coming weeks. Once you have that clarity, youâ€™ll find moving forward so much easier.Â </p>
<p>Be warned that Taurus season might leave you feeling a tad overwhelmed. Know that itâ€™s OK to take some time to yourself to get introspective. And donâ€™t hold on to anything thatâ€™s no longer serving youÂ â€“ now is a good time to let go of patterns that have overstayed their welcome.Â </p>

<h2>Cancer</h2><p><i>21 June to 22 July<br />
	  </i></p>
<p>The spotlight is on you this month â€“ all eyes are on Cancer. The timing can be a bit annoying as you feel that youâ€™re not on your A-game. It is very important that you dot every i and cross every t, especially in the workplace. Take your time in everything that you do and allow yourself to be a great example.Â </p>
<p>The reason youâ€™re being so closely watched? Thereâ€™s an opportunity for growth. Those eyes are sticking around to make sure youâ€™re the right fit. Situations will be thrown at you and youâ€™ll be judged by how you respond. Stay calm and stay true to yourself. Nowâ€™s the time to hone your skills in showing your best self during tough times.Â </p>
<p>Towards the end of the month, youâ€™ll feel an itch to step out of your norm and experience new things. What entertained and energised you previously isnâ€™t clicking the way it was before. That might feel uncomfortable at first, but embrace the chance to do things differently. You might discover something wonderful.</p>
<h2>Leo</h2><p><i>23 July to 22 August<br />
	  </i></p>
<p>Ooh, Leo. This month is going to be a real journey of self-discovery. Youâ€™ve relied on your cheerful disposition to keep trucking along, but your energy is running out. Now you want to reflect. Lean into that desireÂ â€“ going deep can be frustrating at first, but so beneficial long-term.Â </p>
<p>The powerful solar eclipse will ramp this up, unearthing some wounds that havenâ€™t yet fully healed. Youâ€™ve been telling yourself these issues have already been addressed and resolved, but thatâ€™s not the case. Thereâ€™s still some work to be done. Be gentle with yourself.Â </p>
<p>At the end of April, youâ€™ll be ready to let go of some baggage. As a result, youâ€™ll enter May with renewed hope and optimism.Â </p>
<h2>Virgo</h2><p><i>23 August to 22 September<br />
	  </i></p>
<p>Youâ€™ve got a lot on your mind this month, Virgo, and you donâ€™t feel ready to talk about it. With Mercury, your planet, in retrograde, youâ€™d rather keep it hush-hush than make any mistakes. Youâ€™ve been feeling the transformative energy around you rerouting you to the direction youâ€™re supposed to be in. You respect it, but it doesnâ€™t make this uncomfortable moment better. However, you are VirgoÂ â€“ there is nothing that revised routines and healthier habits canâ€™t fix. Youâ€™re just getting yourself ready for the task.</p>
<p>However, there are times in which we have to dig deeper to get to the root of the problem. This eclipse will show how you tend to hold your cards close to your chest when it comes to your motivations, passions and excitement, as if you were to get too excited then something would go wrong. Come on, Virgo: you know thatâ€™s not the right approach. Let yourself believe that good things can happen.Â </p>
<p>As the sun enters Taurus, youâ€™ll feel a push to believe in yourself more. Make this a month of empowerment, of honing your routines to feel like your best possible self. Itâ€™s a good time to shake things up a little; seeing a new perspective can be uncomfortable but will prove immensely helpful in your journey.Â </p>
<h2>Libra</h2><p><i>23 September to 22 October<br />
	  </i></p>
<p>Brace for irritation, Libra â€“ the people closest to you are getting on your nerves this month. Mercury retrograde means misunderstandings are at an all-time high, and while youâ€™re <i>trying </i>to keep the peace, your patience is running thin. The way through this? Keep an open mind and do your best to clear up any confusion.Â </p>
<p>That irritation might start to morph into an itch to break free, but try not to make any rash decisions. Take a moment to think things through and have a conversation with the person at the heart of the issues to see how you can move forward. And have a ponder on whatâ€™s going on internally that makes you want to run for the hills. Fear of emotional intimacy, is that you? As the month goes on, youâ€™ll find it easier to open up.Â </p>
<h2>Scorpio</h2><p><i>23 October to 21 November<br />
	  </i></p>
<p>Usually your vibe is all about being cool, calm and collected. Thatâ€™s not the case this month. Youâ€™re flustered, accident-prone and aggravated. The best way to deal with this is to <i>slow down</i>. What can you do to restore your inner balance? How can you adjust your routine to better handle the ups and downs? Make tranquillity your focus word for April.</p>
<p>Towards mid-month, there will be a focus on the important relationships in your life. Whether romantic or platonic, you will notice that there may be a disconnect between you and the people you care about. Your mind is on some issues at home, with your family or some personal emotional frustration. Scorpio, you canâ€™t avoid dealing with this situation. If youâ€™re having a hard time working through this, ask for some help.Â </p>

<h2>Sagittarius</h2><p><i>22 November to 21 December<br />
	  </i></p>
<p>Youâ€™re in the mood to explore and have fun this month. Go for it! Try new things, follow your interests and do what brings you joy. But try to be considerate of other people in your life at the same time; donâ€™t bulldoze, no matter how tempting that might be. Compromise and collaboration are key. Remember, Sagittarius: it doesnâ€™t always have to be your way or bust.Â </p>
<p>The full moon towards the end of the month will bring situations that have been under your nose to your attention. Donâ€™t be alarmed: tune back into the routines and rituals that keep you steady and remember the end goal. Itâ€™ll all be worth it when you get what youâ€™ve been hoping for.Â </p>
<h2>Capricorn</h2><p><i>22 December to 19 January<br />
	  </i></p>
<p>Your home life is chaotic right now. Breaking glassware, plumbing issues, annoying housematesâ€¦ you name it, youâ€™re experiencing it. A lot of this is coming from clumsiness and bad communication, but it feels like a rain cloud is perpetually over your home space. You probably feel this way because you know itâ€™s <i>more </i>than just bad communication and absent-mindedness causing this chaos. Thereâ€™s an emotional blockage. We know getting vulnerable isnâ€™t your thing, Capricorn, but sometimes itâ€™s necessary.Â </p>
<p>The solar eclipse will push you on that need to dig deeper emotionally. Ever heard of the quote â€œas above, so belowâ€? Often when the exterior world feels hectic, itâ€™s a reflection of inner turmoil. We get so distracted emotionally that we cause mayhem in our lives by being snappy, clumsy, forgetful. Whatâ€™s really eating you up inside? Get to the root of your feelings and youâ€™ll notice all the other stuff starts to smooth outÂ â€“ plus, youâ€™ll be better equipped to deal with all the ups and downs.Â </p>
<p>As Taurus season arrives, youâ€™ll be ready to let your hair down. Go for it, Capricorn. Fun is important, especially when youâ€™re holding on to stress. A touch of spontaneity at the end of the month can bring some luck and opportunity your way.Â </p>
<h2>Aquarius</h2><p><i>20 January to 18 February</i></p>
<p>Be warned, Aquarius: miscommunication is going to be a big theme for you this month. Your words and actions are being misinterpreted; your power is being read as intimidating; people are taking offence where none was intended. Work as hard as you can on communicating clearly, but try to give other people the opportunity to do the same. Youâ€™ll need to listen this month. As in, <i>actually </i>listen. Drop the defensiveness and hear what others are trying to tell you.Â </p>
<p>This mess will encourage you to ask where that tendency to put a wall up comes from. Youâ€™ll ask how you can start to take the wall down, brick by brick. Be patient with yourself and lean into this energy of self-realisation.Â </p>
<p>As you heal your inner self, youâ€™ll want to heal your home life and closest relationships, too. Thereâ€™s been a disconnect there, right? Taurus season is a great time to work on that. This wonâ€™t be an easy process, but itâ€™s well worth it.Â Â </p>
<h2>Pisces</h2><p><i>19 February to 20 March<br />
	  </i></p>
<p>Pisces, youâ€™re usually so great at going with the flow. So why are you so rigidly holding on to certain ideas and beliefs that youâ€™ve now outgrown? Doing this could be holding you back from exciting opportunities. Itâ€™s time for you to accept that people grow and changeÂ â€“ including you.Â </p>
<p>Do you doubt that youâ€™re ready for big things? Do you worry youâ€™re not worthy? April will be a moment for you to realise you are equipped for it all. Once that realisation hits, security can settle in. Let yourself believe in your ability and good things will happen. The 11th is looking like an especially great day for big ideasÂ â€“ keep a notepad handy to write any down.Â </p>
<p>Once youâ€™ve done that deep emotional work, itâ€™s time to live it. Think about ways to integrate this new mindset into everyday life. Communicate with others about your ideas and do it comfortably. Connecting with like-minded people will make this process super enjoyable.Â </p>

Weird and wonderful, artful and ugly, this debut feature from cinematographer Sean Price Williams offers a damning verdict on a splintered America, as seen through the eyes of a girl who never really seems to know quite what sheâ€™s looking at.</p>
<p><i>The Sweet East</i>, which stars Talia Ryder (<i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/film/best-high-school-movies/562134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Do Revenge</a></i>), Ayo Edebiri (<i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/tv/the-bear-disney-plus-tv-uk-release-date-cast-plot-trailer/704215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bear</a>, <a href="https://staging.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/bottoms-teen-movie-references-easter-eggs/835989" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bottoms</a></i>) and Jacob Elordi (<i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/film/saltburn-best-twisty-movies-to-watch-next/857560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saltburn</a>, Priscilla</i>) is a deft play on the classic literary trope known as the Heroâ€™s Journey. The film adheres to the recognisable structure: a daring protagonist (usually a knight of some description) embarks on a quest, leaving behind all that is familiar in favour of lands unknown, meeting an array of larger-than-life characters who help or hinder them along the way. Itâ€™s a framework that has been updated, tweaked and feminised before: <i>Alice In Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz,</i> even David Bowieâ€™s cult classic <i>Labyrinth</i>.Â </p>

<p><i>The Sweet East </i>follows in this tradition. We follow our heroine, Lillian, a listless, quiet high school senior from North Carolina, as she sets off on a journey across the northeastern coast of America, meeting an array of increasingly strange oddballs from niche subcultures along the way. During a school trip to Washington, she falls into the company of a punk Marxist group, before meeting a creepy neo-Nazia academic, a couple of pretentious indie filmmakers and a lonely Vermont farmer. Like any good coming-of-age drama, <i>The Sweet East</i> lets Lillian try on new personas, learning from and mimicking the people she encounters. She assumes the role of violent leftist vigilante with ease; she morphs into a ribbon-bedecked Lolita, playacting naive sexuality with the frustrated neo-Nazi, Lawrence; she transforms next into a budding starlet who parties the night away, flirts with her famous co-star and giddily graces the covers of tabloids; she willingly assumes the role of beautiful prisoner in the Vermont farmhouse.</p>

<p>As the ever-transformational Lillian, Ryder presents us with a girl who is listless and uninformed. Her opinions about what she sees and hears are kept quiet â€“ that is, if she has any opinions at all. Her rare contributions consist of mocking and sardonic smiles. Ryderâ€™s performance is subtly, quietly drawn, although the character herself is frustratingly blurred at the edges.</p>
<p>The characters she meets along the way are all superbly, precisely crafted caricatures. Edebiri brings her signature wit and humour to the role of Molly, an affected film director. The perfectly cast Elordi oozes charm and charisma as Ian, â€œthe nationâ€™s crushâ€ and a rather dim actor. Rish Shah (who previously appeared alongside Ryder in <i>Do Revenge</i>) gives an affecting, unsettling turn as the soulful, proprietary Mohammad.</p>
<p>In a classic Heroâ€™s Journey tale, the hero always succeeds: against all odds, they vanquish their enemies, they achieve their goal, they reach their destination. But in the fractured, straining modern America of <i>The Sweet East</i>, this tidy conclusion doesnâ€™t quite work â€“ instead, our heroine has, it seems, no clear goal, no set destination. And so, she floats into an ever weirder and wackier world that eventually loses its grip on reality altogether â€“ Vermont is transformed into a landscape painting; Lillian sees a cartoon image through the barrel of a gun; she winds up at a fantastical monkâ€™s castle on a windswept cliff.</p>

<p>Lillian is a modern-day Alice. But instead of rising above the madness and clamouring back out of the rabbit hole, you get the sense that the madness she has seen has seeped into her very core.<i> The Sweet East</i> is a beautiful trip of a film that captures the sheer oddness of growing up as a woman today in a world of bizarre political leanings and inexplicable obsessions â€“ a world where people are increasingly cocooned in their own little worlds. In Williamsâ€™ portrait of America, it is a society on the verge of mental breakdown â€“ and it seems that, having grown up in this chaos, his heroine can only dive in headfirst.</p>

And it doesnâ€™t stop there. The <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/mixie-cut-pixie-mullet-hair-trend/578634" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mixie cut</a> is already up there with 2024â€™s edgiest trends, while long bangs are set to rise in popularity.</p>
<p>But <i>the</i> haircut set to dominate the year? Meet the â€˜kitty cutâ€™. Great for those in that awkward <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/grown-out-crop-haircut/667893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growing-out-my-bob phase</a>, itâ€™s a mid-length haircut that involves <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/invisible-layers/706109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tons of layers</a>. Even better, your kitty cut is tailored to your <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/the-golden-rules-of-good-hair-care-simple-steps-to-get-beautiful-happy-healthy-hair-celebrity-hairdresser-tips-advice/135381" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hair texture</a>, meaning it requires minimal styling for a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hush-cut-hair-trend/815098" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">low-maintenance approach</a>.</p>
<p>Intrigued? We asked two experts â€“ <a href="https://larrykinghair.com/products/lucy-jones" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucy Jones</a>, hairstylist at <a href="https://larrykinghair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Larry King</a>, andÂ <a href="https://www.instagram.com/louisbyrneiciaiw/?hl=en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Louis Byrne</a>, editorial artist at <a href="https://www.lorealprofessionnel.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lâ€™OrÃ©al Professionnel Paris</a>Â â€“ to break down everything about the trend. From how to style it to what to ask for in the salon chair, hereâ€™s all you need to know to nail the look.</p>
<h2>What is the kitty cut?</h2><p>â€œThe kitty cut is a version of the undone <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/butterfly-bob-hair-trend/823617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">textured lob</a>,â€ says Jones. â€œItâ€™s a great style if you are growing out a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/bob-haircuts/685946" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bob</a> and adds subtle shape and extra volume. Creating longer layers and a chunky face frame can accentuate the cheekbones giving a feline effect to the eyes, hence the name.â€</p>
<h2>How do you wear the kitty cut?</h2><p>â€œThis cut is very versatile; it can be worn straight or curly,â€ says Byrne. â€œIt looks great with <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/best-volumising-hair-foam/784960" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added volume</a> and will give you the ultimate swish.â€</p>
<h2>What is the best way to style the kitty cut?</h2><p>â€œUndone and easy,â€ says Jones. â€œUse <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=29063&awinaffid=293071&platform=dl&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cultbeauty.co.uk%2Flarry-king-hair-care-my-nanna-s-mousse-150ml%2F13708826.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Larry Kingâ€™s My Nannaâ€™s Mousse</a>, Â£22, to add plumpness and shine, using just your fingers to tease out natural texture under the hairdryer and finish with a mix of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/best-fine-hair-styling-products/696311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finishing cream</a> and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/best-texture-spray/740381" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">texture spray</a>.â€</p>
</p>
<p>Byrne says: â€œIf you would like to wear this style straight I recommend blow-drying your hair using a round brush or a diffuser. I also like to use rollers and <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=2041&awinaffid=293071&platform=dl&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boots.com%2Floreal-professionnel-tecni-art-super-dust-hair-powder-7g-10338911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lâ€™OrÃ©al Professionnel Tecni.Art Super Dust Powder</a>, Â£18.55, for extra volume and bounce.</p>
<p>â€œIf you wish to wear this cut curly, simply <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/loreal-professionnel-mythic-oil-hair-review-buy/359534" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apply oil</a> to the ends of your hair before going in with the <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=2082&awinaffid=293071&platform=dl&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lookfantastic.com%2Fl-oreal-professionnel-steam-hair-straightener-styling-tool-for-all-hair-types-steampod-3-uk-plug%2F12343647.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lâ€™OrÃ©al Professionnel Steampod</a>, Â£235, for a smooth finish. Ultimately your hair texture will bring out the best of this cut.â€</p>
<h2>What should you ask for in the salon to achieve the kitty cut?</h2><p>â€œThere are quite a few versions of the kitty cut, so any picture references would be recommended when going into the salon,â€ advises Jones.</p>
<p>Byrne adds:Â â€œEnsure you and your hairdresser are using the same language. Pick your top three images and use these as a guide for your stylist and let them advise you on how your <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/the-golden-rules-of-good-hair-care-simple-steps-to-get-beautiful-happy-healthy-hair-celebrity-hairdresser-tips-advice/135381" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hair texture</a> will work best with the length and style.â€</p>

Even the fashion experts here at <i>Stylist</i> are no strangers to those last-minute mornings full of desperate rummaging for clothes that only end up on the floor moments later. But the item that comes to the rescue time and time again is the humble and hard-working dress. </p>

Nevertheless, if you find the right dress, itâ€™ll forever be one of the most effortless ways to look and feel put-together.Â </p>
<p>So, where to start with finding a dress thatâ€™ll do all of the hard work for you? <i>Stylist</i>â€™s all-knowing fashion director, Lucy Reber, has stepped up to the plate to provide her edit of the most versatile new season dresses to suit every style, budget and occasion.

<p>If itâ€™s bright, bold and exciting youâ€™re looking for, red is in no short supply, thanks to designs inspired by the collections shown at Fashion Week last month. And if clean lines and formal fits are more your style, youâ€™ll find dresses inspired by the Coperni, Victoria Beckham and Zimmermann spring-summer runways, too.Â </p>

<p>Cos are certainly experts in office-friendly outfits, turning formal fits into more fashion-forward moments that still work brilliantly for other occasions, too. To really lean into the corp-core trend, pull out your kitten heels, pointed-toe pumps or slingbacks to wear with this style and shrug on a blazer to elevate it even further. Heading out for the evening? Opt for statement shoes that compliment the vibrancy of the dress like this metallic Mango option.Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you spend a lot of time online, you might have seen the phrase â€œtouch grassâ€ cropping up in lengthy comment sections. Itâ€™s often used as a (not super-friendly) reminder to take a break from the toxic abyss of the internet and to get outside into the real worldÂ â€“ the implication being that, in spending too much time online, the individual has lost touch with the world outside their laptop screen.</p>
<p>While telling someone to â€œtouch grassâ€ may be a veiled insult, there is actually a bit of truth to itÂ â€“ as, according to a new study, getting outside into nature is one of the best ways to boost your <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/diversity-inclusion-workplace-business-authentic-self/465489" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">authenticity</a> and, yes, reconnect with the reality of being a human being.Â </p>
<p>If you work on a computer all day, you might find that you spend most of your time inside staring at a screen. At the end of a long day filled with blue light, email notifications and keyboard tapping, you might find yourself feeling strangely disconnectedÂ â€“ not only from the real people around you, but also with your own self. According to this study,Â we might all need to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/spend-time-in-nature/865975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">go touch grass</a>, asÂ spending a little more time outside can help us get back in touch with our <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/why-i-gave-up-trying-to-be-authentic-and-you-should-too/736741" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">authentic selves</a>. In turn, it can lead to a more authentic inner dialogue with ourselves and more authentic relationships with others.</p>
<p>We spoke toÂ <a href="https://ellemace.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle Mace</a>, a Positive Psychology Coach, about the strong link between nature and authenticityÂ â€“ and why it matters.</p>
<h2>What is authenticity, anyway?</h2>
<p>Before getting into the study, letâ€™s talk about what psychologists mean when they talk about authenticity. When we think about someone who is â€œauthenticâ€, we tend to imagine someone who is good at simply being themselves â€“ someone who avoids putting on airs or acting out a role.</p>
<p>However, authenticity in psychology is a little more complex. It relates not only to expressing oneâ€™s true self, but also whether we are able to grasp and comprehend our own feelings, beliefs and desires. Further, it involves acting based on our values and needs despite societal pressures, and being open and honest in our relationships.</p>
<p>According to Mace, this kind of authenticity is vital to our personal happiness and to the health of our relationships.</p>
<p>â€œCultivating authenticity is important for personal well-being and fulfilment because it allows individuals to live in alignment with their true selves, fostering genuine connections, self-acceptance, and psychological resilience,â€ she says.</p>

<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Two women talking while drinking tea" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2022/05/15093659/women-talking-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>About the study</h2>
<p>The study, published in the <i><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspi0000432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</a>Â </i>in January 2024, aimed to understand why nature and authenticity go hand in hand. They worked with the hypothesis that â€œnature fosters authenticityâ€ and that â€œauthenticity mediates the positive influence of nature on longer term psychological well-being (higher life satisfaction and meaning in life, lower depression, anxiety and stress)â€.</p>
<p>Researchers examined these four points by surveying 10,000 participants, evaluating their connection to nature, and compared the results to their personal sense of authenticity. They found thatÂ there was a clear link between nature connectedness, engagement in nature-related activities and authenticity.</p>
<section class="pp-article__boxout">

<div class="pp-boxout__body">
<h4>Nature fosters authenticity</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>In a second study, the researchers compared people who lived in natural environments with those in urban environments. Once again, they found that natural habitats increased authenticity. A third study explored how spending time in nature could improve an individualâ€™s sense of inner authenticity, thus increasing personal satisfaction.Â </p>
<h2>Why nature is linked to building authenticity</h2>
<p>Ok, so the study shows that getting outside and, yes, touching grass can make us more authentic, both in our relationship with ourselves and with others â€“  but why?</p>
<p>Well, as you might have guessed, it gives us an opportunity to get back to the basics of our own humanity. With a break from the chaos of modern life, we get the chance to reconnect with who we are at our core. After all, you canâ€™t be honest with others if you canâ€™t be honest with yourself â€“ and getting outside helps you do just that.</p>
<p>â€œBeing in nature can facilitate the development of authenticity because it often provides a space for reflection, introspection and connection with oneâ€™s innermost thoughts and feelings,â€ Mace says. â€œAway from the distractions and pressures of daily life, nature encourages individuals to be present and tune into their authentic selves.â€</p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>How can we all add some nature (and authenticity) into our lives?</h2>
<p>Getting outside is one of the best ways to boost your own sense of authenticity â€“ but itâ€™s no secret that finding the time and space to get out into nature isnâ€™t always easy.</p>
<p>Mace suggests you make nature a priority in your schedule.Â </p>
<p>â€œPlan outdoor activities such as <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/walking-mental-health-benefits/471657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">walks</a>, hikes, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/home/how-to-tablescape-a-picnic/544220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">picnics</a> or simply spending time in a nearby park,â€ she says. Even if itâ€™s just ten minutes in a local park during your lunch break, it might help you reconnect with your inner, authentic self.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s also important to be mindful about <i>how </i>you engage with nature once youâ€™re out and about. â€œIncorporate mindfulness practices into everyday life,â€ she says. â€œ<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/walking-mindful-hiking-fitness-mental-health/441404" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mindful walking</a>Â or taking a few moments to appreciate natureâ€™s beauty can help individuals connect with their authentic selves amid busy schedules and being around other peopleâ€™s noise.â€</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ask a woman how she is and after the initial, cursory â€˜All great, thanks!â€™, youâ€™re likely to hear the word â€™<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/tired-all-the-time-solutions/538827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tired</a>â€™. Most of usÂ â€“ apart from those annoying people you know who are somehow always glowing and free of dark circlesÂ â€“ are bloody exhausted. Weâ€™re so busy <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/hurry-sickness-causes-how-to-treat/746253" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rushing around</a> and getting stuff done that weâ€™re in desperate need of proper rest, and when you chuck in all the issues we can face when it comes to sleep, the wiped-out cycle continues.Â </p>
<p>This, inevitably, affects our work. And work affects our exhaustion. Thereâ€™s another fun cycle for you.Â </p>
<p>Women, in particular, are hit hard by this. <a href="https://berlincameron.com/research/2022/3/7/the-exhaustion-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The exhaustion gap</a> is a term that refers to the overwhelming impact of work (both in the office world and at home) exhaustion on women, pointing to stats that show women are more likely to experience burnout and stress as they juggle the demands of their careers with household and caregiving responsibilities. Weâ€™re <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/work-life-balance-research-tips/787302" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">struggling to find any semblance of work/life balance</a>, with long, busy hours leaving us with little time or energy to do even the basics of self-care, let alone pursue our other goals.Â </p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s evident that women in the workplace experience higher levels of burnout and exhaustion than men,â€ LinkedIn career expert Charlotte Davies tells <i>Stylist</i>. â€œWeâ€™ve all felt the additional strain from the last few years, and while flexible working arrangements have been designed to help, our research still shows that one in five women believe that itâ€™s harder to achieve a work-life balance now compared to 20 years ago.</p>
</p>
<p>â€œWithout the right balance, burnout can occur, and if we donâ€™t spot the signs and tackle them early on, then our health can really suffer. Itâ€™s important to have open and transparent conversations about the help and support we need when things are getting too much, and know where to find the tools that will help better manage these particularly challenging periods in our lives.â€</p>
</p>
<p>How do we start to navigate the imbalance and tackle our tiredness? Davies shares five tips ahead.Â </p>
<h2>Be open and honest when youâ€™re struggling</h2><p>â€œItâ€™s much more beneficial to you and your employer to acknowledge when youâ€™re struggling and feeling overwhelmed, rather than suffering in silence,â€ Davies says. â€œHaving an open, honest conversation with your boss and coming up with a plan together can help to manage your workload and avoid the exhaustion gap.â€</p>
<h2>Get comfortable saying â€˜noâ€™</h2><div>Hereâ€™s a tough fact to swallow: you canâ€™t do everything. You canâ€™t just keep â€˜pushing throughâ€™ when your workload is too much to bear and you canâ€™t keep taking more and more on because youâ€™re a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/long-reads/people-pleaser-dangers/811678" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people-pleaser</a> and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/dealing-with-perfectionism/630324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perfectionist</a> who just wants to be great at their job. Sometimes, you do have to say â€˜noâ€™ and â€˜Iâ€™ve got too much onâ€™. Sorry!</div>
<p>Davies notes: â€œNearly half (47%) of women who think itâ€™s more difficult to maintain a positive work-life balance now say that a â€˜grind cultureâ€™ is one of the key contributors to this, according to recent research commissioned by LinkedIn. Itâ€™s important to be able to set boundaries in both our work and personal lives to ensure we have time to rest and recover.â€</p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Find techniques to help you feel in control</h2><div>â€œFinding the right tools can be instrumental in helping you keep calm and feel in control in tricky situations and also means youâ€™re more likely to be able to switch off after a stressful working day,â€ Davies suggests. â€œLinkedIn Learning courses such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-resilience/what-why-and-how-to-become-resilient?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A62e188a3498edc49e4ec38bf&u=36053556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building Resilience</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/embracing-unexpected-change/building-personal-resilience?u=36053556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Embracing Unexpected Change</a> can set you off on the right foot.â€</div>
<p>You might also like to try <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/one-good-thing-morning-mindful-meditation-practice/822043" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mindful meditation</a>Â or block off time in your calendar just for strategising or repeating affirmations. Play around to find what works for you to help you feel less overwhelmed by your day-to-day tasks at work.Â </p>
<h2>Make self-care a priority</h2><div>Another fact that can be tricky to accept: you canâ€™t do your best work if youâ€™re not your best self. And in order to be your best, you need to look after yourself. That means getting enough sleep, taking time off, eating nourishing food, getting outdoors and consciously taking steps to manage your stress levels.Â </div>
<p>Davies recommends: â€œTry to commit to doing the things that make you feel that little bit less stressedÂ â€“ it can be something as small as a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/why-we-should-all-be-walking-during-our-lunch-breaks-according-to-psychologists/348240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lunchtime walk</a> around the block. The more you put into yourself, the more youâ€™ll be able to give to both your work and personal commitments.â€</p>
<h2>Find the right place for you</h2><p>â€œOften, managing your work-life balance, no matter the skills and techniques you put in place, can still be difficult if your workplace doesnâ€™t support it,â€ Davies tells us. â€œIf youâ€™ve tried some of the above and youâ€™re not satisfied with where you are, it could be time to start looking elsewhere. Using <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/find-job-opportunities-companies-share-your-values-linkedin-rajiv/?trackingId=T1tpIdWcYjF7vQZzqK90OA%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedInâ€™s Job Search Filter</a> can help you find companies that prioritise the work-life balance of their employees.â€</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What are you doing in Shrekâ€™s swamp? Self-care, of course. And weâ€™re ogre the moon about it.</p>
<p>Inspired by the beloved ogreâ€™s home, this <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/lush-sustainable-beauty-guide/513259" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lush</a> collection features a Shrek Swamp bath bomb, Get Outta My Swamp shower slime, Fiona shower gel, Gingy bubble bar, By Night One Way, By Day Another body spray and a Donkey bath bomb.</p>
<p>The scent of the Shrek Swamp bomb has notes of chocolate mixed with uplifting peppermint, pink pepper and rich vanilla, while the Fiona shower gel has a light, fruity scent of lime and green grass.</p>
<p>Lushâ€™s popular Mask of Magnaminty face and body mask, which has lovingly been dubbed â€˜Shrek Packâ€™ by South Korean shoppers thanks to its particular green hue, is also joining the collection with a special Shrek label to mark the occasion. </p>
<p>Melody Morton, creative concepts director at Lush, said in a statement: â€œI love how <i>Shrek</i> is a family film I enjoyed when I was in my teens and now my own teenager loves all the meme culture of <i>Shrek</i> today. Itâ€™s a classic film that celebrates self-love and was an obvious fit for a Lush collaboration. Itâ€™s earthy and fun and perfect for some swampy self-care.â€</p>
<p>The Lush x Shrek collection launched on the Lush app on Friday, 22 March. Itâ€™s available at selected stores (Lush Oxford Street, Lush Studio Beak Street, Lush Liverpool, Lush Edinburgh and Lush Glasgow City) and on the companyâ€™s website from today, 25 March 2024. </p>

			<description>Millions of us live with chronic backpain from rubbish work set-ups, but there are ways to ease the niggles that donâ€™t involve forking out for a chiropractor or dosing up on ibuprofen. Mollie Quirk found a free, quick and simple solution to her lower back issues in the form of a daily YouTube yoga practice.</description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days, itâ€™s more unusual to say that you <i>donâ€™t</i>Â have <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/best-exercises-stretches-for-back-pain/373391" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backache</a> than you do. During the pandemic, we went from ergonomic office desks to working <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/series/working-from-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from our kitchen tables</a>Â and sofasâ€¦ and four years on, many of us still donâ€™t have great at-home set ups for our hybrid routines. The result? Crunchy necks, screaming hips and sore lower backs.</p>
<p>My own backache began mid-lockdown. Iâ€™d been working between the sofa and a low vintage bureau and by summer 2020, my breakfasts were laced with paracetamol or ibuprofen. That continued <i>for years</i>, and while I was still functional, I became aware that I was relying on painkillers to simply function. Clearly, something needed to changeÂ â€“ and that something had to be my posture.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s not a unique story; back in 2020,Â <a href="https://www.bupa.co.uk/health/payg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bupa</a>Â found that 11 million people were suffering with new aches and pains due to working from home. Fast forward four years, and almost a million people in UK are now too sick to work because of back or neck issues, with the welfare bill for dealing with back suffers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/19/back-and-neck-problems-driving-major-uk-health-crisis-say-medical-leaders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">costing Â£1.4bn a year</a>Â â€“ up 25% compared with before the pandemic.Â </p>
<p>Back pain isnâ€™t just an inconvenienceÂ â€“ itâ€™s life disrupting. It stops you from working well, exercising properly, socialising regularly. And we still donâ€™t treat it seriously.</p>
<section class="pp-article__boxout">
<div id="boxout_1" class="pp-boxout" style="background-color:#606060;">
<div class="pp-boxout__body">
<h4>Back pain isnâ€™t an inconvenience â€“ itâ€™s life disrupting</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>The most obvious first step, if your work station is to blame, is to sort out your working environment. So, I began by investing in a new desk and office chair. Out went my lovely cow print number and in came a pink mesh orthopaedic chair and and table that allowed me to work more efficiently. Weirdly, however, the pain didnâ€™t subside â€“despite my posture naturally improving.</p>
<p>So, I decided that something more drastic needed to happen: a 30-day fitness challenge focusing on posture and back strengthening.</p>
<p>To get a steer on the sorts of things I should be trying, I chatted to Adam Byrne, a physiotherapist at Bupa Health Clinics. He explained that poor posture can lead to muscle imbalance which results in pain throughout the back. If you sit with one leg under the other, you inevitably end up lop-sidedâ€¦ which might put more pressure on one glute, one side of the spine, one shoulder etc. </p>
<p>After being prescribed a handful of exercises, I scoured the internet for more posture-correcting exercises and stretches to try. After being bombarded with an array of results, I decided to focus on two different techniques from two different experts.Â </p>
<p class="">Emi Wong was the first YouTuber I stumbled across. With almost 5 million subscribers and thousands of comments boasting success from her tips and tricks, how could I not give her advice a go? But then I then found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VuLBYrgG94" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AskDoctorJoâ€™s YouTube channel</a> and was instantly drawn in by the array of videos she had posted on back pain. With almost 2 million subs, she was a definite contender.</p>
</p>
<p>I decided to alternate between Emi and Jo for the first two days to see which technique and sets of exercises suited me best and what worked efficiently and quickly.</p>
<p>On day one, I tried Joâ€™s routine but it just didnâ€™t work for me â€“ I found the videos long-winded and tricky to understand, especially as a fitness novice. I jumped straight into Emiâ€™s video after watching five minutes of Jo, and was instantly drawn in with the way she taught the exercises. I was able to understand with ease and found that I could do the exercises alongside her.  </p>
</p>
<p>So, what is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLfIsFl1Cac&vl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emi Wongâ€™s <i>Fix Your Posture in 10 Minutes</i></a>Â all about? There are 10 different exercises that last for 50 seconds each, with a 10-second rest between each exercise. Itâ€™s so easy to follow that by the end of week one, I no longer needed to watch the video during my workoutÂ â€“ I could just listen as I moved.Â </p>
<p class="stylist-youtube"><div class="iframely-youtube iframely-player iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="FIX YOUR POSTURE IN 10 MINUTES | Best Daily Exercises ~ Emi" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/QLAscTW?maxheight=1200" data-img allowfullscreen scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture *; web-share *;"></iframe></div></div></p><p>The first time I completed the full workout, I was absolutely exhausted. But by the time week one had come to a close, I was in the swing of things and felt rejuvenated and refreshed. The movements soon became second nature, and each day, my back felt a little better.  </p>
</p>
<p>By the end of the entire month of following Emiâ€™s routine, I was shocked at how far I had come. After work every day, I would stop for a break before heading to my room to practise this routine after four weeks, was almost pain-free. I still do the routine every day and will probably continue to do so for the foreseeable future because it actually <i>works</i>.Â </p>
<p>Even taking a one-minute break from my desk in the middle of the day to do one of these exercises for 50 seconds has proved to be a game changer. So, what are you waiting for?</p>

<h2>The 10-minute posture-fixing workout</h2><h3>Chest opener</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Sit on the floor cross-legged</li>
<li>Bring your hands behind your head, elbows out openÂ </li>
<li>Now close your elbows so they end up pointing ahead of you â€“ squeezing your shoulder blades together</li>
<li>Repeat for 50 seconds</li>
</ol>
<p>My arms did feel a little heavy at first but after about day four, my arms felt stronger and more supple, which made the exercise easier.</p>
<h3>Wall slideÂ </h3>
<ol>
<li>Sit cross-legged with your back flat against the wall</li>
<li>Raise your arms above your head with them also flat on the wall</li>
<li>You then slide your arms down the wall, bending your elbows</li>
<li>Repeat for 50 seconds</li>
</ol>
<ol>
</ol>
<h3>Glute bridge</h3>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Lying on the floor, bend your knees and place your feet about an inch from your bum</li>
<li>Keeping your head and shoulders fixed, raise your bum and core so that your pelvis is in the air</li>
<li>Either keep your arms flat on the ground next to you, or lace your fingers under your back</li>
<li>Stay in position for 30 seconds, then bring your butt back down</li>
</ol>
<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="Glute Bridge_ Alice" data-img data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/B5y47Um?maxheight=1200" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media *"></iframe></div></div><h3>All four twist</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go into table top (on hands and knees)</li>
<li>Keeping one hand on the ground, twist the opposite side and raise the other arm as you do so</li>
<li>Look up to the sky, pause for 25 seconds then switch sides</li>
<li>If you want to make this more tricky, alternate between left to right every few seconds</li>
</ol>
<h3>Ab stretch</h3>
</p>
<p>As a big fan of yoga, I was already familiar with the ab stretch because itâ€™s almost exactly the same as the classic cobra pose.Â </p>
<ol>
<li>Lie on your front with your forearms resting on the ground</li>
<li>Extend to raise your chest and core, stretching your stomach and back as you look up to the ceiling</li>
</ol>
<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="Stretchin10_Cobra" data-img data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/uENdvYH?maxheight=1200" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media *"></iframe></div></div><h3>Down dog twist</h3>
<p>Much like the downward facing dog, this twist exercise really pulls on your back â€“ which is such a great feeling after being hunched over a laptop all day.Â </p>
<ol>
<li>Start off standing</li>
<li>Bending the knees, lean forwards to bring your hands to the floor and walk them forward until youâ€™re in a kind of triangle with your bum in the air, your arms straight and your knees softly bent</li>
<li>Take your right hand off the floor and stretch to touch your left toes (keeping your other hand firmly on the ground)</li>
<li>Hold for 25 seconds</li>
<li>Now go back to downward dog and repeat on the other side for 25 seconds</li>
</ol>
<h3>Back squeeze pulse</h3>
<ol>
<li>Lie on your stomach with your chest and core slightly raised.Â </li>
<li>Move your arms out in front of you then bring them back and squeeze your shoulder blades together in a pulsating movement for three repetitions</li>
<li>Moving your arms back and forth, continuing the process for 50 seconds.Â </li>
</ol>
<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="Stretchin10_prone angel" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/ZUSuJpK?maxheight=1200" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media *"></iframe></div></div><h3>Swimmers</h3>
<p>Back swimming takes a lot of stamina and can feel exhausting, but itâ€™s such a good exercise for your back and core.Â </p>
<ol>
<li>Lying on your belly, start with your legs and arms outstretched</li>
<li>Slowly start to mimic breast stroke, by making circles with your arms and legs</li>
<li>Repeat for 50 seconds</li>
</ol>
<p>With this move you can really feel your shoulders rotating and your back squeezing in the middle.Â </p>
<h3>Cat cow</h3>
<p>Lastly, the cat cow is a really great move to end on. This exercise releases almost all the tension built up throughout the workout.</p>
<ol>
<li>In table top position, round your back and bend the neck so that youâ€™re looking towards your belly button</li>
<li>Breath deeply before retracting the shoulders and looking up to the ceiling</li>
<li>Repeat five times</li>
</ol>
<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="Stretchin10_catcow" data-img data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/jEVBJgM?maxheight=1200" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media *"></iframe></div></div><p><i>Images: Getty</i></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/strength-training-health-benefits/263787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strength training</a> can get pretty complex, especially when it comes to deciding how you structure your workouts. Like most sports, there are multiple ways to approach your training depending on your goals and personal preference â€“ and that includes whether youâ€™re going to prioritise weight or reps.  </p>
<p>While it can be tempting to try to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/lift-heavier-weights/537920#:~:text=The%20best%20way%20to%20do,lift%20it%20off%20the%20ground." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lift as heavy as possible</a>, struggling to complete one rep probably isnâ€™t going to help you build strength in the long run. The same is true on the opposite end of the spectrum: while opting for a weight you can overhead press for hours might make you feel accomplished, itâ€™s probably not going to do much. </p>
<p>Ultimately, you want to find a sweet spot between the two. But does that mean prioritising one over the other, at least to begin with? And if so, how can you tell when itâ€™s time to increase both your weights and your reps?Â </p>
<h2>What are the benefits of increasing reps when strength training?Â </h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="A woman strength training at home" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/08165518/strength-training-reps-1120x1120.jpg">

</figure>
<p>While strength training is all about priming your muscles to support heavier loads, there are benefits to increasing the number of reps you do in a session â€“ including when it comes to endurance and overall fitness. </p>
<p>â€œWorking in a higher rep range helps to improve the ability of your muscles to perform over an extended period,â€ explains Ali Malik, a personal trainer and founder of <a href="https://www.fitlabskensington.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fit Labs Kensington</a>. â€œPerforming more reps with shorter rest intervals can also elevate your heart rate and enhance cardiovascular conditioning.â€ </p>
<p>Because increasing your reps typically requires you to drop the amount of weight youâ€™re dealing with, this style of strength training can also provide benefits for joint and ligament health, explains Amanda Place, a personal trainer and founder of <a href="https://www.sculptrition.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculptrition</a>.</p>
<p>â€œIt also helps you to build resilience, not only in your workouts but in various aspects of life, as you have to push through fatigue,â€ she adds. â€œIntegrating a range of rep schemes into your training can help you to achieve a well-rounded and effective weight training regimen.â€</p>
<p>And thatâ€™s not forgetting that high-rep routines can also help to reduce the risk of injury that comes with lifting heavier weights, because youâ€™ll be more in control of your movements.Â Â </p>
<h2>What are the benefits of increasing weight when strength training?Â </h2><p>Thereâ€™s something particularly satisfying about being able to up the dumbbell size you use in your workouts, and being ambitious with the weights you use can offer plenty of benefits. That is, if you do it gradually. </p>
<p>â€œIncreasing the weight you are lifting is known in training terms as <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/progressive-overloading-home-gains/472832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">progressive overload</a>,â€ Malik explains. â€œThis is a fundamental principle in strength training and exercise science that involves gradually increasing the demands placed on your muscles, typically by lifting heavier weights or increasing resistance overtime.â€ </p>
<p>The benefits associate with this progressive increase in weights are numerous, including increased strength, and muscular hypertrophy, or growth.Â </p>
<p>Itâ€™ll also help you develop power and explosiveness â€“ something youâ€™ll want for sports that require sudden movements â€“ and can even stimulate the development of stronger bones. This is why strength training is such a good form of exercise for women <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/strength-training-hormone-benefits/831003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">both pre- and post-menopause</a>, who are at greater risk of osteoporosis due to their changing hormones.</p>
<p>â€œProgressive overload also requires increased joint stability and muscle activation, which can help to protect against joint injuries and enhance overall joint health,â€ Malik adds.Â </p>
<h2>Is it better to increase reps or weight?Â </h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="A woman picking up a dumbbell at the gym" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/11/08165534/strength-training-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The right decision for you will largely depend on the goal youâ€™re trying to achieve, as well as the stage youâ€™re at in your training.Â </p>
<p>Place explains: â€œIf you aim to maximise muscle size and strength, lifting heavier weights with lower repetitions is the preferred approach, as it promotes hypertrophy and significant muscle growth. On the other hand, increasing the number of reps with lighter weights is more effective for improving muscular endurance.â€ </p>
<p>In most cases, both experts say itâ€™s usually beneficial to incorporate a mix of both approaches into your training. This is a process known as periodisation, where you go through cycles in your training â€“ in this case, it would be training with lower weights and higher reps (known as a hypertrophy or volume phase) and training with heavier weights and lower reps (known as a strength phase). </p>
</p>
<p>A balanced approach can also prevent you from reaching a plateau in your training, which can take a toll on your motivation levels. Ultimately, you just want to make sure youâ€™re always being challenged.Â </p>
<h2>How to tell when you should increase your reps and weightÂ </h2><p>Want to switch up your strength training, but not sure whether youâ€™re ready to up your reps or weight? Malik recommends considering the following three things: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Are you breezing through your reps? </b></li>
</ul>
<p>â€œIf you are making the deadlifts with ease, you may not be challenging yourself enough,â€ Malik says. â€œEvery strength training program has specific goals that determine the weight, reps and sets to undertake for each exercise. Hitting the top of your rep range during your sets with proper form can be a sign to go up in weight.â€ </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Are you seeing results?  </b></li>
</ul>
<p>â€œThe goals set for your strength training class should dictate how heavy you can lift and the way to achieve it,â€ he says. â€œThere are different ways to achieve your fitness goals other than increasing your weight, such as increasing the number of reps. However, if you have been hitting the gym without much progress, it may be time to consider increasing weight to align with your fitness goals.â€ </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Is your form flawless? </b></li>
</ul>
<p>â€œAll the weight increase hype may be futile if the body isnâ€™t ready to handle the extra kilos,â€ Malik explains. â€œYou may need to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/how-to-do-perfect-squat-stronger-glutes/362473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ensure that your form is perfect</a>, allowing you to perform the specific exercise safely. The effects of increasing weight without proper form may result in serious injuries, especially for strength-building exercises that may put a strain on your spine.  </p>
<p>â€œHaving great form allows you to record consistent progress over time. You may choose to record yourself as you do the sets to identify areas you may be doing wrong. Stagnating at the same weight over several weeks can slow down your fitness journey. Knowing when to add weight to your exercises is a critical part of your strength training programme.â€Â </p></p>

<p>In the short term, it gets the blood and oxygen circulating around the body to make you feel more alert.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/sleep/napping-how-to-nap-sleep-advice-insomnia/336807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">To nap or not to nap</a>? That is the question I ask myself pretty much every day when my brain and body feel sluggish in the middle of the afternoon.  </p>
</p>
<p>Itâ€™s natural for our <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/how-to-fix-circadian-rhythm/631378" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circadian rhythm</a> (the 24-hour process that regulates your sleep-wake cycle) to dip after lunch, and thatâ€™s what leads to low energy. But there are also other reasons why you might feel the need to lie down and close your eyes, like broken sleep or <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/how-to-get-to-sleep-quicker-eating-dinner-later/632030" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eating dinner late at night</a>.</p>
<p>In a bid to combat this tiredness, it can become second nature to make yet another cup of coffee or reach for a sugary snack. But those solutions, at best, act as sticking plasters. At worst, they can exacerbate fatigue by keeping you up at nightÂ â€“ leaving you feeling tired again the next afternoon.Â </p>
<p>Iâ€™m lucky enough to work for myself from home and have childcare sorted until 5pm most days, which means if Iâ€™m hit by fatigue, I can close my eyes for a short time. Iâ€™ve become well-known among family and friends for my love of a good â€˜Kat napâ€™.</p>
<p>Years of working shifts and early mornings means I can drop off at pretty much any time of day and, as long as itâ€™s not for too long, I usually wake up feeling refreshed. But, is a nap the right choice for coping with afternoon sluggishness? Or should I be using this time to get my blood flowing and muscles working instead?Â </p>
<h2>Benefits of exercise for energy and focus</h2><p>Thereâ€™s no right or wrong way to tackle tiredness and naps certainly donâ€™t work for everyone. But thereâ€™s plenty of science to suggest that movement can help us to feel more invigorated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeff Kahn, CEO and co-founder of sleep and energy-tracking app Rise Science, tells <i>Strong Women&nbsp;</i>that he&nbsp;believes exercising outdoors might hold the key to beating the 3pm slump: â€œTaking a walk and getting outside is great for getting light during the day, which is an often overlooked part of sleep and circadian health. It will also help with blood flow in your body and â€˜wake upâ€™ your muscles and brain.â€ </p>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/exercise-long-term-effects-benefits-physical-mental-health/398762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">benefits of exercising</a> for both mind and body are undeniable. â€œEver since I started working out regularly, I havenâ€™t felt tired at all,â€ says formerly tired travel writer Helen Iatrou. â€œQuite the opposite: it gives me a huge surge of energy.â€</p>
<p>In fact, a few of the women I chat to anecdotally cite naps as something that make them feel even more tired&nbsp;â€“ and workouts leave them feeling more alert. Iâ€™m the same: after choosing a workout over a nap, the endorphins released give me the energy I need to get through bath and bedtime with the kids. All that physical exertion also definitely helps me to sleep better.&nbsp;</p></p>

<p>But finding the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/exercise-motivation-best-workout-tips/627822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">motivation to exercise after work</a> or when youâ€™re tired can be really hard, especially during the winter months when itâ€™s cold and dark at 4pm. This is something mother-of-two Vicky says she struggles with: â€œI (usually) choose to nap, but often regret it. Iâ€™m not sure that Iâ€™ve ever regretted a workout. But my god, itâ€™s hard to feel motivated to move when the alternative is a good nap.â€Â 
	  </p>
<h2>Benefits of napping for an energy reboot</h2><p>There are times when your body may really need to rest and recuperate, especially if youâ€™re struggling with ongoing sleep deprivation or illness. This is when a daytime nap, even just for 20 minutes, could really help.</p>
</p>
<p>Sophie Elletson, lead nutritionist at Future Woman, believes a nap can be more beneficial for women than exercise. She explains that if your cortisol levels spike too much, it can destabilise the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (the communication pathway between the brain and the pituitary and adrenal glands), which can then down-regulate your reproductive hormones.Â </p>
<p>â€œThis is why <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/period-problems-chronic-stress/549053" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">women who over-exercise can lose their periods</a>,â€ she says. â€œSo, we always encourage clients to focus on gentler forms of exercise like walking, yoga or pilates when theyâ€™re feeling stressed and overwhelmed. A gentle walk outside is ideal for that afternoon slump.â€Â </p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="woman doing resistance band workout" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/01/25125121/gettyimages-1341378766-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But Elletson maintains that sleep is the best way to stabilise your HPA axis. Napping is a great way of calming the system, while aiming for a minimum of seven hours sleep a night.Â </p>
<p>Kahn agrees: â€œSleeping during the day can help you boost your energy levels and reduce your sleep debt without having to go to bed early. However, naps that are too long can lead to sleep inertia. In contrast, short power naps of 10-20 minutes can help you feel energised when you wake up.â€</p>
<h2>Which is better for energy&nbsp;â€“ exercise or sleep?</h2><p>Napping and exercising both have clear benefits for our mental and physical wellbeing. And being able to do either in the afternoon is a massive luxury that many of us just donâ€™t have. But perhaps for those of us who do WFH a few days a week, maybe 2024 should be the year that we prioritise downing tools in the afternoon for a brief energy-booster&nbsp;â€“ whether weâ€™re running, jumping or napping.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When was the last time you felt a real sense of achievement? That lightning bolt rush of adrenaline, joy and disbelief that comes with conquering something that, at one point, seemed insurmountable? Mine was last month when, at the age of 39, I swam 25 metres for the first time in my life. </p>
</p>
<p>Some people conquer marathons or mountains, but my Everest has always been the swimming pool. When I was a child, a teacher let go of me in the water and I panicked and sank. I can still picture how annoyed he was when I re-emerged, spluttering and crying. Without encouragement or support, I remained in the shallow end, clinging to the side, while my friends progressed to the deep end and dived for bricks. To complete my embarrassment, my mum had won a fancy Slazenger swimsuit, making me the best-dressed learner who couldnâ€™t even doggy-paddle a width.Â </p></p>
<p>That fear may have taken root in a pool in Cumbria sometime in the early 90s, but instead of tackling it, I simply avoided swimming for 30 years and being a non-swimmer became my dirty secret. I missed out on birthday parties and school trips, lazing in hotel pools and drifting in the sea on holiday. I told myself that I â€œcouldnâ€™t floatâ€ â€“ something Iâ€™d heard my parents say â€“ and adopted the reason myself, adding to the family myth that we were scientific anomalies that defied the laws of physics. </p>
</p>
<p>It wasnâ€™t until I was on my honeymoon in 2022, when I looked at the Caribbean sea from the safety of my sun lounger, that I thought maybe I was missing out by not frolicking in the turquoise waters. I began to question the narrative Iâ€™d been pedalling for three decades: could I really not float and learn to swim? Or had I simply never faced my fear?Â Â </p></p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Hands holding a swim float" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2024/03/15104857/holding-a-swim-float-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I decided I didnâ€™t want to hit 40 having never learned a skill that most people master as children â€“ which is how, six months later, I found myself back in the shallow end. Only this time, I was a 38-year-old in armbands convinced I was going to drown in knee-high water.  </p>
</p>
<p>I may have felt ridiculous to be learning to swim as an adult, but Iâ€™m certainly not alone in trying to do so. According to Swim England, <a href="https://www.swimming.org/swimengland/one-three-adults-cannot-swim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one in three people over 16 in England canâ€™t swim</a> 25m unaided, and about 50,000 adults are learning. Thatâ€™s an amazing stat, given that â€“ according to counsellor <a href="https://www.georginasturmer.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgina Sturmer</a> â€“ adults tend to avoid activities that scare us.</p>
<p>â€œAs children we are often given the opportunity â€“ or are required â€“ to try new things, to face our fears, to push ourselves out of our comfort zone. Yet as adults, we usually have the power to say no, to sit back on the sidelines if we are feeling frightened, to stay stuck in our existing patterns of behaviour and relationships,â€ Sturmer tells Strong Women. â€œThis might feel comforting, but it can also represent a missed opportunity to learn and grow, and to build new neural pathways that can help us to think differently.â€ </p>
</p>
<p>It took some time before I began to feel positively about voluntarily putting myself in a position of possible death on a weekly basis. At first, I was useless. I had to google how to put a swimming cap on and my goggles kept filling with water. I snorted what felt like a pail of chlorine. One week, it took me 45 minutes to lean back on a foam noodle. At one point, my teacher declared I was â€œin discord with the waterâ€, to which I tersely replied: â€œYes, since about 1991.â€Â Â </p>

<div id="boxout_1" class="pp-boxout" style="background-color:#606060;">
<div class="pp-boxout__body">
<h4>It took me 45 minutes to lean back on a foam noodle</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>My progress felt agonisingly slow and I wondered how I would ever go from clutching a float to being free of one. Then in week 17, the decision was made for me when my teacher physically prised it from my hands and told me I was ready. I didnâ€™t wholly believe her, but I also realised the only way I was ever going to do it was by telling myself I could. In a literal sink-or-swim moment, I pushed off the side and, for the first time, I swam unaided. I was practically euphoric. </p>
</p>
<p>Mindset psychologist Dr Rebekah Wanic says my breakthrough came from realising that I needed to think differently about the situation.Â Â </p></p>
<p>â€œOur beliefs about what we can and canâ€™t accomplish influence what we will and will not do. A big part of working towards a meaningful goal is believing there are things you can do to get yourself closer to it,â€ she says. â€œWhen you realise your mindset is either facilitating you in achieving your goals in life or holding you back, and you learn to have control over it, you are so powerful.â€ </p>
</p>
<p>Once I realised that I could swim, that I could float, that I wasnâ€™t necessarily going to <i>drown</i>, my attitude shifted. As someone motivated by goals, I began to set myself targets to swim 5m, then 10m, 15m and 25m. Within weeks, I had not only achieved them all but bought the rainbow-coloured badges meant for children to prove it. Each achievement left me punching the air, sometimes even eliciting a clap from the lifeguard or a â€œwell doneâ€ from a fellow swimmer.  </p>
</p>
<p>But as proud as I am of my progress, I regret not tackling it sooner. I regret that I waited until I was almost 40 to fix something that, all told, was conquered in about 13 hours. <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/stylist-10th-birthday-important-life-milestone-celebration-psychology/309133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Milestone birthdays</a> often trigger a sense of reflection, says Sturmer, which is no bad thing. In fact, it can be the opposite.Â </p>

</figure>
<p>â€œIt can add a sense of urgency, and spur us on to create a goal that we really want to achieve by a certain age,â€ she explains. â€œThis can be a powerful and helpful motivational tool.â€ </p>
</p>
<p>Sturmer reassures me that my three decades of dithering are a pretty normal response to fear â€“ a defence mechanism to protect myself because of the fear I experienced as a child. Better yet, all the excuses Iâ€™ve made have been necessary steps on the path to change, adds Wanic, because without them, I wouldnâ€™t have needed to confront them and set the goal in the first place. </p>
</p>
<p>â€œSometimes we think: <i>If I had dealt with this earlier, I wouldnâ€™t have missed out</i>. Everybody has experiences where theyâ€™ve wasted time or not confronted things; thatâ€™s a natural part of life,â€ says Wanic. â€œBut once you recognise that, you can let that define you or you can use it as motivation. Let the twinge of regret show up â€“ but donâ€™t let it just sit there, because all itâ€™s going to do is prevent you from moving forward.â€ </p>
</p>
<p>As for my next goal, thereâ€™s a 50m badge with my name on it. And yes, to those wondering, I might even sew it onto my swimsuit.Â Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Welcome back to Stylistâ€™s Sleep Diaries, where we take a deep dive into one of the most important (and elusive) factors in our day-to-day lives: sleep. To help us understand more about it, we invite women to share their habits with our sleep expert <a href="https://drnerina.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Nerina Ramlakhan</a> for analysis.Â Â <br />
	  </i></p>
<h2>About me</h2><p><b>Age:</b>Â 26</p>
<p><b>Occupation:</b> Journalist</p>
<p><b>How much water do you drink on average per day?</b>Â 6-8 glasses</p>
<p><b>How much caffeine do you drink on average per day?</b>Â 2 cups of coffee</p>
<p><b>What time do you go to bed at night?</b> Around midnight.</p>
<p><b>What time do you wake up in the morning?</b> Between 6am and 8am.Â </p>
<p><b>How often do you exercise?</b>Â I do lots of walking every day but only go to the gym around once a week at the moment to do some cardio as Iâ€™m pretty busy. </p>
<p><b>Do you eat breakfast within 60 minutes of rising?</b> Yes.</p>
<h2>My story</h2><p><i>â€œMy levels of stress and anxiety are heightened at the moment and itâ€™s taking itâ€™s toll on my sleep and energy levels. For the last year Iâ€™ve found I either fall into a deep sleep and wake up feeling tired or sleep lightly and have lots of vivid dreams. These dreams arenâ€™t recurring but often involve tense situations where things are going wrong, so I feel anxious when I wake up.Â </i></p>
<p><i>â€œItâ€™s made a huge difference to my energy levels. Iâ€™d rate mine about a three out of 10 at the moment just because of how lethargic I feel: coffee has become an essential part of my day, because without caffeine I find it hard to muster the energy I need to do my job.</i></p>
<p><i>â€œWork is definitely a factor here: the amount of work I have on my plate can be challenging, and I take work home or do overtime in the office most weeks. That has a knock-on effect on my whole schedule, so I end up eating dinner late (between 8-9pm) and skipping the gym. In all honestly, some of my commitment to working overtime does come from a wish to quieten my stress and anxiety, because when Iâ€™ve got something to focus on its less present.</i></p>
<p><i>â€œAt the end of the day Iâ€™d love to feel more energised and rely less on caffeine â€“ Iâ€™m just not sure how to get to that point with my stress and anxiety draining me. Can you help?â€</i>Â </p>
<h2>So, what does it all mean? Sleep expert Dr Nerina Ramlakhan shares her thoughtsâ€¦</h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Dr Nerina Ramlakhan Stylist's sleep expert" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/10/02172423/hr-nerina-3-1120x1120.jpg">

</figure>
<p>â€œIâ€™m glad youâ€™re taking time to eat breakfast as morning anxiety levels can worsen if you donâ€™t because your body starts to run on cortisol (and caffeine),â€ says <a href="https://drnerina.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sleep expert and physiologist Dr Ramlakhan</a>. â€œAlong those lines, I hope youâ€™re eating before you have your cup of coffee â€“ if not, thatâ€™s a change Iâ€™d recommend.</p>
<p>â€œYou could really benefit from trying some simple stress management techniques and the one I would recommend is to start your morning with a simple breathing practice. You should try to do this before you dive into your day â€“ even before you look at your phone.  </p>
<p>â€œTo get started, place your left hand on your belly just below your navel and the other hand over your heart. Simply notice the rise and fall of your breathing. Ideally, follow five inhales and five exhales while breathing through your nose. Gently experiment with making the exhales a little longer, sending them out through your lower body. This will help you to anchor yourself before you start your day.â€Â </p>
<p>She continues: â€œFor an even greater boost to energy and mood, add a simple minute journaling practice focusing on gratitude to this morning routine. What are you looking forward to today? What are you grateful for?</p>
<p>â€œScientific research shows that people who have a good morning routine tend to be more productive, have lower stress levels and are generally happier and more optimistic, so find what works for you and stick to it.â€Â </p></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Living with pain can be, wellâ€¦ a real pain. The throbbing agony of a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/morning-headache-causes-prevention-treatment/463250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">headache</a>, twisted ankle or period cramps can leave us doubled-up on the sofa, too distracted to do anything and feeling miserable. Sure, you can reach for some over-the-counter painkillers for a quick fix, but what if youâ€™ve already maxed out on your dose for the day or youâ€™d rather avoid drugs altogether? </p>
</p>
<p>Can you really find temporary relief from searing pain without reaching for the ibuprofen or paracetamol? </p>
</p>
<p>â€œMedication does have a role in helping people deal with pain signals, particularly when the pain is acute and can help with inflammation,â€ says pain expert Dr Amber Johnston, clinical psychologist and neuropsychologist at <a href="https://www.healthymindpsychology.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Healthy Mind Psychology</a>. â€œBut many medications out there merely mask the pain, and if the pain is chronic or without a clear healing process, this medication can become addictive or ineffective.â€</p>
<p>Dr Johnston explains that pain is an important messaging system alerting the brain to a problem (eg â€˜remove hand from boiling waterâ€™). But inflammation also plays a role in ongoing or chronic pain: â€œCortisol is released whenever we need additional energy to deal with stress, and that includes when experiencing pain. We also understand that too much cortisol release can cause increased inflammation in our bodies, which can also send chemical alerts to our brain in the form of pain experiences. </p>
</p>
<p>â€œNatural ways to reduce inflammation â€“ everything from eating well, attempting to get enough sleep, moving our body and managing cortisol â€“ can all play a part, without reaching [straight] for the pills,â€ she adds.Â </p>
<h2>7 drug-free ways to relieve pain, according to the expertsÂ </h2><p>It goes without saying that relieving pain is only part of the solution. If pain persists or youâ€™ve picked up a longer-term injury, you should always consult a medical professional for a personalised treatment plan. For milder issues or immediate relief, however, here are seven pain-relieving remedies, as recommended by medical experts. </p>
</p>
<h3>Freeze pain with the RICE method for sports injuries </h3>
</p>
<p>Ice is your friend here. Cold therapy has been used in pain management for decades due to its ability to reduce inflammation by decreasing blood flow. But you donâ€™t have to head to your nearest (and often expensive) cyrotherapy chamber to reap the injury-soothing benefits. Dr Vishal Aggarwal, of <a href="https://healthiumclinics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Healthium Clinics</a>, recommends using the RICE method (rest, ice, compression, elevation) to relieve pain from sprains and strains.  </p>
</p>
<p>He says: â€œRest the area, applying an ice pack for 15-20 minutes every two hours during the first 48 hours to reduce swelling, while using a barrier to prevent direct contact with skin. Compression with a bandage helps control inflammation, but not so tight that blood flow is restricted. Elevation of the injured limb reduces swelling and promotes blood flow.â€Â </p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>

<h3>Soothe pain with heat </h3>
</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s science behind hugging a hot water bottle when youâ€™re suffering from PMT. Applying heat to an affected area can help reduce pain by <a href="https://www.uhcw.nhs.uk/download/clientfiles/files/Patient%20Information%20Leaflets/Clinical%20Support%20Services/Therapies/Physiotherapy/Heat%20and%20cold%20therapy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promoting blood flow and relaxing the muscles</a>, in turn reducing painful muscle spasms. </p>
</p>
<p>If using the RICE method on a swollen injury, Dr Aggarwal recommends applying a heat pack approximately 72 hours afterwards.Â </p></p>
<h3>Stimulate pain-relieving acupressure points </h3>
</p>
<p>This arm of traditional Chinese medicine, based on the concept of â€˜qiâ€™ (or energy flow), has been used in pain management for centuries. But if you canâ€™t access an acupuncturist, you can stimulate acupressure points at home with no need for needles. </p>
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sheringhamacupuncture.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acupuncturist Saffron Pretty</a>Â explains: â€œAn <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/acupuncture-for-stress-recovery-clinic/666998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acupuncture point</a> is a bundle of fibres, one of which is usually a nerve. You should press these points firmly with your thumb until they hurt, so you get a response from the nerve and, therefore, the brain.â€</p>
<p>She recommends you consult an acupuncturist for the most effective treatment as â€œpoints are not just specific to the condition but also the personâ€. However, as a generic pain reliever, Pretty suggests stimulating what are known as the four gates. â€œThis is an ancient combination of two points â€“ large intestine 4 (LI4 â€“ a point on the hand) and liver 3 (Liv3 â€“on the foot). Theyâ€™re often used to manage pain in childbirth and some dentists learn LI4 as itâ€™s also good for toothache.Â </p>
<p>â€œFind LI4 on the top of the hand, on the fleshy mound between the thumb and forefinger, close to the forefinger bone. Liv3 is on the top of the foot, between the tendons of the big toe and second toe.â€Â </p>
<p>Pretty recommends searching online for a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Anatomical-location-of-real-acupuncture-point-Siguan-four-gates-and-sham-acupoints_fig1_326486254" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visual guide</a> to pinpoint the exact location.</p></p>
<h3>Rinse with saltwater for mouth-related aches</h3>
</p>
<p>Ulcers, swollen gums and toothache can often lead to off-the-chart levels of pain. Before you head to the dentist to investigate, temporary pain relief is possible via a basic store cupboard ingredient. </p>
</p>
<p>Dr Julia Coelho, dentist at <a href="https://www.thedoorw4.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Door W4</a>, explains: â€œA saltwater rinse can be extremely effective in treating inflammation, helping to ease pain and reducing the bacteria in the mouth and gums that causes the pain. Rinse with saltwater two to three times a day, especially after meals.â€Â </p>
<p>You can make a salt mouthwash by dissolving half a teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water.</p>
<h3>Reduce period pain with anti-inflammatory foods </h3>
</p>
<p>Hannah Alderson, nutritionist, hormone specialist and founder of <a href="https://www.hannahalderson.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Positive Method</a>, says: â€œHerbs, foods and supplements with anti-inflammatory properties are the way to go.â€  </p>
</p>
<p>However, Alderson adds that managing pain associated with periods and conditions such as <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/endometriosis-hiking-pain-benefits/807433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">endometriosis</a> and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/pcos-awareness-month-2022-experts/705604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCOS</a> requires a holistic approach involving diet, exercise and stress management: â€œShifting your body into a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/recipes/anti-inflammatory-foods-diet/435956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">less inflamed state</a> doesnâ€™t happen overnight. A bout of period pain is unlikely to be tamed quickly with one turmeric latte. Patience is key.â€&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Becoming less inflamed doesnâ€™t happen overnight</h4>
<p>Hannah Alderson</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>Aldersonâ€™s recommended foods to prioritise:  </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Turmeric:</b> â€œTop of the list due its curcumin content â€“ a molecule famed for its ability to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664031/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ease swelling and reduce inflammation</a>, as well as support the reduction of free radical damage. Boost its effectiveness by consuming it alongside black pepper.â€ </li>
<li><b>Green tea:</b> â€œEpigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), one of the major phytochemical components in green tea, is effective in the management of pain through <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33372878/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suppression of inflammation and oxidative stress</a>.â€ </li>
<li><b>Clove:</b> â€œContains eugenol, which is a natural pain reliever.â€ Several scientific studies have concluded that clove oil can kill bacteria, reduce inflammation&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16530911/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">relieve pain</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Breathwork and meditation can reduce pain </h3>
</p>
<p>Donâ€™t underestimate the power of relaxation. <a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/blog/adult-pain-medicine/newsfeed-post/diaphragmatic-breathing-why-it-is-the-secret-weapon-against-chronic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Researchers at the Pain Rehabilitation Center</a> found that 10 minutes of diaphragmatic breathing three times a day reduced pain when done consistently for at least two weeks. </p>
</p>
<p>Dr Johnston believes initiating a relaxation response is a primary way to reduce levels of cortisol in the system, and therefore pain. She says: â€œMindfulness practice and deep, regular breathing gives the body the message that it is OK and not under threat, even when the pain signals are continuing.â€Â </p>
<p><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/how-to-breathe-coherent-breathing-exercise-anxiety-stress-calm-deep-breaths/397867" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Try these simple breathing exercises</a> to dial down the stress and reduce pain.Â </p>
<h3>Use distraction techniques to boost endorphins </h3>
</p>
<p>â€œPain signals are naturally trying to alert your attention, but [sometimes these alerts can be] too loud and unnecessary for the situation,â€ says Dr Johnson. â€œUse your thoughts to tell your body and brain that youâ€™re overriding these messages, and aim to focus your attention on anything that may bring some interest or pleasure instead.â€ </p>
</p>
<p>Movement, socialising and pleasure-seeking arenâ€™t just about taking your mind off the pain: they can also boost endorphins, the <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/endorphins-the-brains-natural-pain-reliever" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bodyâ€™s natural painkilling hormone</a>. The word â€˜endorphinâ€™ actually derives from the term â€˜endogenous morphineâ€™, as it is supposed to mimic the opioid.</p>
</p>
<p>Dr Johnston appreciates that it is tempting to stay home alone when in pain but is clear that â€œit helps to engage with others. Get out and go somewhere that has good memories or brings a feeling of connection.â€</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first time I thought I had a brain tumour, Iâ€™d had a headache for two days and gone on a WebMD spiral. Iâ€™ve never been a headache person, but I am a serial worrier, which means that the symptom checker has a permanent seat on my list of most visited websites. Most of the time, I stop feeling stressed because my symptoms disappear before I even realise theyâ€™re gone. But this was different.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, my headaches ebbed and flowed but never totally stopped. What scared me more was that half of my face felt numbÂ â€“ kind of like a dentist had injected me with local anaesthetic and it was slowly starting to wear off.</p>
<p>I ran my symptoms through as many checkers as I could find and started cross-referencing the most common results. Some kind of neurological condition seemed inevitable.</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="ChloÃ« James selfie" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/10/25101318/365408845_251931847760199_1539560371294882904_n-e1698225275697-907x907.jpg">

<p>The thing is, for someone who stresses out so much about their health, Iâ€™d always had an aversion to doctors, hospitals, or anything that may confirm I am in fact unwell. But as weeks became months, I found myself withdrawing. I couldnâ€™t focus. I started making stupid mistakes with my work. Iâ€™d have fun, then sober myself with the reminder that I was probably going to die. My friends or my boyfriend would make future plans, and in my head, Iâ€™d respond, â€œI probably wonâ€™t be here, though.â€</p>
<p>Eventually, I reached breaking point. My headaches started in February and by May I was probably crying more often than not. I was self-aware enough to recognise Iâ€™d become a nightmare to live with, talk to, or even remotely know. Begrudgingly, I made an appointment to see a doctor. My appointment took a grand total of two minutes as he listened to my symptoms, found the nearest neurologist, and told me to get an MRI asap.</p>
<p>By this point, I was so stressed that I didnâ€™t really know how to feel anything else. In some ways, Iâ€™d transcended stress and just accepted my fate. <i>I wonder if Iâ€™ll be able to get the money back for my flights this summer</i>, I thought as I changed into the gown for my scan. <i>It sucks that I probably wonâ€™t be allowed to fly once I start my treatment</i>.</p>

<p>As I live in Dubai, all healthcare is private. In this case, it was a major perk as I received my MRI results in a matter of hours. I waited for them in the hospital until I was called back to my neurologistâ€™s office, where she smiled and said, â€œCongratulations, you have a beautiful, healthy brain.â€</p>
<p>I went home elatedÂ â€“ but the feeling didnâ€™t last long. If my head was healthy, then why was this happening? The neurologist had suggested that my numbness may be the aura of a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/migraines-at-work-and-social-situations-taken-more-seriously-national-migraine-week/293408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">migraine</a>, the sensory disturbances that kick in before or during an episode, but I knew the location and nature of my headache wasnâ€™t typical of a migraine.</p>
<p>Two months later, I made a different appointment. My symptoms hadnâ€™t changed, but I had. I was snappy and uninterested in everything. I went to Disneyland â€“  literally the happiest place on earth â€“ and wondered why, even while riding Space Mountain, I always felt like I was a few steps away from actually enjoying myself. It was only when a friend mentioned seeing her psychiatrist that I decided maybe I should, too.</p>
<p>My psychiatrist was approachable but thorough. I cried in the first 10 minutes because I didnâ€™t know what to say other than the fact I felt nothing. I realised I meant that in every sense of the word. My face wasnâ€™t the only thing <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/emotional-numbness-feeling-empty/628708" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feeling numb</a>; I hadnâ€™t had a genuine emotion other than stress or nothingness in a long time. In passing, I mentioned the physical symptoms Iâ€™d experienced over the past few months. He nodded and carried on.
	  </p>
<p>At the end of my session, he told me I was depressed. I shouldnâ€™t have been surprised. Iâ€™d had depression before, but that was years ago and it hadnâ€™t felt like nothing. I felt too much of everything, and â€˜everythingâ€™ was always negative. When I explained this, convinced heâ€™d got it wrong, he nodded again and prescribed me antidepressants.</p>
<p>I had taken antidepressants before. Last time, Iâ€™d taken SertralineÂ â€“ an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) that increases the production of serotonin, a hormone that regulates your mood. Now, my psychiatrist thought Iâ€™d respond better to Bupropion, which restores the balance of dopamine and norepinephrine (the chemicals responsible for pleasure and motivation) in your brain.</p>

</figure>
<p>Sertraline had dulled the sadness that ravaged me through my late teens. This time, it was like Bupropion was slowly waking me up, but I didnâ€™t notice until my next check-up. My psychiatrist was delighted with my progress and asked about my headaches and numbness. Shocked, I realised theyâ€™d improved, too. How had something I obsessed over for months disappeared so quietly?</p>
<p>My psychiatrist noticed my surprise and explained that the physical effects of depression are, like the condition itself, unpredictable. â€œSome people get headaches,â€ he said. â€œSome people donâ€™t.â€ When I asked why nobody had suggested depression as the cause before, he shrugged and said, â€œGeneral practitioners donâ€™t think about this stuff.â€</p>
<p>While I donâ€™t like to think about the months I wasted mourning my life while it went on without me, I also make a concerted effort not to feel too guilty. Depression is so prevalent is because itâ€™s sneaky. It can manifest in ways you donâ€™t even imagine, with the NHS listing everything from aches and pains to constipation and low sex drive as symptoms.</p>
<p>If anything good came out of this experience, itâ€™s that Iâ€™ve witnessed firsthand just how complex and powerful my brain can be. Itâ€™s technically me, but itâ€™s not always on my side; it can spot cracks in my defences before I even know they exist, and has no qualms in taking me to the darkest places imaginable. Considering my past experiences, I thought I had a pretty good understanding of depression. Now I know that there is no one way to experience mental illness â€“  and that in itself feels like a start.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With another <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/international-womens-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Womenâ€™s Day</a> behind us, itâ€™s a good time to ask if anything is really changing for women. Closing the gender pay gap has <a href="https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/news/fawcett-responds-to-latest-gender-pay-gap-reporting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stalled</a>, major companies are cutting their DEI investments and the World Bank <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2024/03/04/new-data-show-massive-wider-than-expected-global-gender-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently discovered</a> that the global gender gap is far larger than previously thought. </p>
<p>So what will it take for women to be truly equal at work?</p>
<p><a href="https://pregnantthenscrewed.com/its-an-unhappy-mothers-day-as-new-data-reveals-that-mums-earn-43-less-per-week-than-dads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New data analysis</a> from charity Pregnant Then Screwed revealed that mothers make Â£4.44 less per hour in weekly earnings than fathers. Worse still, mothers earned 43% less than fathers based on median weekly earnings, according to ONS data from January to March 2023.</p>
<p>This is the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/money/the-motherhood-penalty/502277" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">motherhood penalty</a>. It covers the earnings gap between parents of different genders, as well as the opportunity costs for women who become mothers and either leave the workforce due to high childcare costs or miss out on career opportunities during key growth years â€“ and in many cases, their careers never recover.</p>
<h2>What is the motherhood penalty?</h2><p>â€œThe motherhood penalty is the systemic disadvantage that mothers experience in the workplace in terms of pay, perceived competence and benefits compared to their childless counterparts,â€ said Joeli Brearley, CEO and founder of Pregnant Then Screwed. </p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s a financial penalty that isnâ€™t just an inconvenience â€“ itâ€™s catastrophic for their quality of life. Itâ€™s why we have a gender pension gap, itâ€™s why women have lower rates of mental wellbeing and it reduces access to good quality housing,â€ she said.</p>
<p>Ultimately the reason the motherhood penalty exists is rooted in maternity and gender discrimination, Brearley explained. The Equality and Human Rights Commission <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/guidance/business/pregnancy-and-maternity-discrimination-research-findings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated that</a> as many as 54,000 new mothers each year lose their jobs due to maternity discrimination, despite pregnancy being a legally protected characteristic â€“ and that number is growing.</p>
<p>Decades ago, a single income could comfortably support the whole family. Dad went to work while Mum tended to the house and raised three kids. Over time, women have taken their place at work and living costs have risen faster than wages have, but our social systems and support from employers havenâ€™t kept the same pace of change.</p>
<p>â€œIt tends to be the mother who sacrifices their career because we have a childcare system that doesnâ€™t work,â€ said Brearley. â€Our antiquated parental leave system tells fathers to go to work and mothers to stay at home and care for their child.â€</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="pregnant woman working on laptop" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/10/18123713/pregnant-at-work-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>The reality of the motherhood penalty</h2><p>For women who want to become mothers, the choice is fraught with sacrifice and uncertainty in their careers. Freya Leete, a PR consultant in Tunbridge Wells, joined a London startup during an exciting growth phase of her career â€“ but not long after disclosing her surprise pregnancy to her employer (which she cannot name due to being bound by an NDA), she found herself without a job.</p>
<p>â€œI walked into what I thought was going to be my six-month review meeting, but instead I was made redundant,â€ she said. â€œI was five months pregnant and couldnâ€™t believe what was happening. I left feeling so angry that they were doing this to me and stressed about how to afford the baby, as I knew the likelihood of another company hiring me at this stage was hugely unlikely,â€ she said.</p>
<p>Freya initially pursued legal advice but eventually negotiated a settlement to prioritise her financial and emotional wellbeing and move forward.</p>
<p>For so many like Freya, the motherhood penalty derails women from their career track â€“ and the consequences can impact the entire trajectory of their professional success. The <a href="https://childpenaltyatlas.org/methodology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Child Penalty Atlas</a>, a research project studying the impact of parenthood on men and womenâ€™s careers globally, found that â€œshortly after the babyâ€™s arrival, womenâ€™s employment plummets sharply, while menâ€™s continues on a relatively smooth upwards trajectory. After a few years, both men and women stabilise â€“ but womenâ€™s employment never returns to pre-child levels.â€</p>
<p>And when a corporate structure doesnâ€™t support mothers the way they need, theyâ€™re pushed out of the workforce completely. Following her redundancy and as a new mother, Freya struggled to find work that suited her. When her second child was eight months old, she decided to go back to work, but she still hasnâ€™t found the career security she had before having children.</p>
<p>â€œMy professional confidence had been left in tatters, so I took a job that I was overqualified for. I still struggle with my confidence and think I always will. I found it really hard to navigate motherhood and my career, always feeling guilty about one or the other. This intensified once my eldest started school, as school and work hours simply donâ€™t make sense. Iâ€™ve now made the decision to go freelance so I can navigate a better work-life balance that aligns with the needs of my family,â€ she said.</p>
<h2>Why fixing the motherhood penalty matters</h2><p>Abolishing the motherhood penalty would be a large stride towards closing the gender pay gap and enabling true gender equality at work. In the UK, <a href="https://childpenaltyatlas.org/?place=GB&metric=fraction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">88% of the gender gap is explained by the child penalty</a>.</p>
<p>And itâ€™s not only mothers or even women who are adversely affected by the motherhood penalty â€“ we all stand to benefit by correcting it. </p>
<p>â€œEveryone should care about the motherhood penalty because it has a massively negative impact on the economy,â€ said Brearley. â€œIf we can create a system where everyone has equal and fair access to the labour market so they are working the hours that they want to, then the benefits to the economy will be enormous.â€</p>
<h2>How workplaces can reduce the motherhood penalty</h2><p>Truly flexible working, bolstered parental leave policies and funding support for childcare can all help to reduce the motherhood penalty. And itâ€™s also crucial to confront bias around pregnancy, maternity and paternity. </p>
<p>Pregnant Then Screwed is calling for six weeks of paternity leave paid at 90%, all parental leave to be paid at the national living wage and childcare to cost 10% or less of household income.</p>
<p>Whether youâ€™re a mother, a future mother, childfree or an ally, itâ€™s going to take all of us to eliminate the motherhood penalty for good.Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There comes a time in everyoneâ€™s life when you realise, with a cold, creeping shock, that you have become boring. My time struck, paradoxically, in a moment of great excitement. Searching to confirm the bin collection post-Christmas, I discovered that â€“ <i>finally! </i>â€“ a major source of grumbling had been resolved. The council where I live would now take the recycling weekly, rather than every two weeks. Upon learning this, I rushed to message my partner, my family, all my friends. I posted a story on Instagram with multiple exclamation points. I felt adrenaline coursing through my veins as images of a clutter-free kitchen and flattened delivery boxes flashed through my mind. It was a true high, followed by the swift comedown of realising who I now was: someone for whom joy comes not from a big night out or illicit substances, butâ€¦ bins. </p>
<p>I have spent a lot of time and effort trying to prevent this from happening. I thought that having lilac hair, multiple tattoos and an exciting job might prevent me from ever being a bore. At parties, I told stories about drinking with fraternities in Massachusetts and that time I went to a nudist swingersâ€™ retreat in Jamaica. But gradually the dullness snuck its way in. I got an <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/food-drink/best-air-fryer-recipes-ideas-2024/868148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">air fryer</a> and found myself talking about it at length. I rejoiced each time a plan was cancelled and I could refuse to move from the sofa for the entire weekend. For Christmas, I asked for a restock of my favourite grey socks from M&S.</p>
<section class="pp-article__boxout">

<h4>We can appreciate whatâ€™s unremarkable but still beautiful</h4>

</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>The thing is, while my teenage self would cringe for all eternity if she discovered she would become someone enthralled by clear storage bins and a cup of tea, I have no shame about my boring transformation. I love being a bore, and this is in large part because it seems like everyone now is. Look at all the home organising influencers, notice just how much chat there is about air fryers, turn on the TV to catch yet another reality show about pottery or buying a home. Everywhere you look, the evidence is there: boring is now cool. The era of borecore is upon us.</p>
<p>But where has it come from? â€œBorecore can probably be traced back to the explosion of TikTok during the pandemic, when enforced isolation and idleness for many (but not for everyone) turned the mundanity of the everyday into our social currency online, as well as our entertainment,â€ Annie Corser, senior trends editor at <a href="https://stylus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stylus</a>, tells <i>Stylist</i>. â€œThe content creation habits formed during that strange time persist today in much of what weâ€™d consider borecore: detailing our takeaways, organising fridges and filming how we do laundry.â€</p>
<p>Perhaps, then, borecoreâ€™s ascension is down to the chaos of those pandemic years (and the political turmoil before and after), and as a society weâ€™ve leaned into the soothing qualities of dull pleasures. You can see it in the world of fashion, where â€˜quiet luxuryâ€™ (read: expensive but not particularly exciting white shirts, black dresses and beige cashmere jumpers) reigned supreme for months last year, while stilettos have been swapped for comfy trainers or business-appropriate chunky loafers ever since the WFH days of the pandemic.</p>
<p>In the past few months, borecore appears to have ramped up even more. Shades of grey (undeniably the dullest colour imaginable) appeared on the autumn/winter catwalks at Prada, Fendi and Bottega Veneta. And the trend thatâ€™s trickled down to the high street, worn by every fashion editor and influencer? A grey knit. Again, dull as dishwater. While once a grey cardigan would be an uninspired option, now, as <i>Stylist</i>â€™s fashion director Lucy Reber puts it: â€œA grey button-down knit is a byword for chic thanks to Miu Miuâ€™s glorious take on this unassuming piece.â€</p>
<p>Once youâ€™ve noticed that borecore has taken hold, youâ€™ll see it everywhere. In our growing fondness for the mundane in our social media feeds, where a video of a woman restocking her guest bathroom has 2.5 million likes. In our spending: â€œThe purchase of air fryers in the UK increased nearly seven percentage points from 2020 to 2022, marking one of the largest jumps for appliances in the market,â€ says Ryan Hui of market research company Mintel. And in the way we pass our time:Â <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-01-22/the-introverts-have-taken-over-the-us-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data suggests</a> young people are spending far less time socialising outside of the house than the same demographic was 20 years ago. The coolness of sex, drugs and rock and roll has faded; people are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-021-02125-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">having less sex</a>, going on <a href="https://studyfinds.org/love-inflation-fewer-dates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fewer dates</a> and <a href="https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/research/alcohol-facts-and-data/alcohol-consumption-uk#howmanypeopledonotdrinkalcohol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">less likely to drink to excess</a>. Rather than going off the rails, young people are casting off â€“ the stereotypically grannyish activity of knitting is <a href="https://www.bigissue.com/life/tiktok-knitting-crochet-gen-z-fashion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the rise</a>.Â </p>
<p>Itâ€™s true that the cost of living crisis likely plays a role in the great bore-ification. Air fryers have become such a hot topic of conversation partly because they cost less to run than using an oven. And when budgets are tight, nights out are one of the first things we cut:Â <a href="https://fareshare.org.uk/news-media/press-releases/cost-of-living-crisis-causing-loneliness-epidemic-for-young-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one YouGov survey from FareShare</a> found that 42% of 18 to 24-year-olds in the UK are reducing socialising with friends due to rising costs. </p>
<p>But bland isnâ€™t all bad. Weâ€™re not choosing blah solely because we canâ€™t afford anything else; weâ€™re turning towards borecore because despite being dull, it also makes us happy. â€œSimple is not simplistic and the little basic details of life can be pleasant and consoling when so much is difficult,â€ notes psychotherapist <a href="https://charlottefoxweber.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlotte Fox Weber</a>. â€œThere is constant <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/mental-health/how-to-embrace-uncertainty/564451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uncertainty</a>Â and indecision about big life issues and we can enjoy enriching our personal lives in whatever small way possible. It might be a piece of fruit, the scent of fresh rosemary or wrapping a gift in a certain way, but everyday chores and activities can be comforting, reliable and self-expressive without demanding that we uproot our lives and do something drastic. </p>
<p>â€œRitualising and noticing ordinary details can go a long way for enhancing experiences. Without spending wildly or making tough decisions, we can appreciate whatâ€™s unremarkable but still beautiful in life. I once heard someone describe the musicality of a washing machine as something they loved listening to; I love this and hadnâ€™t ever bothered to pay attention to the sounds of washing unless it was about a problem. Listening and looking at daily life can be meaningful and utterly worthwhile.â€</p>
<p>There are certain little delights that, if you were to bring them up at a party, would lead you to being labelled the ultimate dullard. But we at <i>Stylist </i>believe these things to be deserving of discussion and, more importantly, celebration. â€œEmbracing ordinary life â€“ allowing yourself to appreciate the everyday â€“ can be life-enhancing and real,â€ Weber agrees. â€œI think a lot of us have resisted being boring for so long or made an apology for boring chat, so Iâ€™m fascinated by what it might do if we were to just say screw it, I like boring things and thatâ€™s fine.â€</p>
<p>With this in mind, we share with you a list of 100 wonderful but undeniably boring joys. These are not things that would traditionally win you cool points if you were to discuss them. They are not something to write home about. And yet we adore them all the same.Â </p>
<h2>100 boring things we truly adore</h2><p>1. Low-stakes cosy crime. A small town rocked by a mysterious outsider smashing up garden gnomes? Sign us up.</p>
<div>
<p>2. The bins being taken just before they started overflowing. Satisfying!</p>
<p>3. Discovering you can cook an entire meal in the air fryer. And telling everyone about it. Itâ€™s now April and Iâ€™m still regaling colleagues with exactly how I cooked an entire Christmas dinner in the air fryer. The roast potatoes were the best Iâ€™ve ever had.</p>
<p>4. A cup of bog standard tea with milk and sugar.Â </p>
<p>5. â€œDoes Old Street roundaboutâ€™s cycling lane count?â€ asks Strong Women editor Miranda Larbi. â€œAnd the Elephant & Castle crossing. Both exceptional town planning.â€ Miranda, it absolutely counts.</p>
<p>6. The two-hour window of greatness every Thursday when <i>Dragonsâ€™ Den</i> is followed by <i>The Apprentice</i>.</p>
<p>7. A good pair of socks. I know many sock aficionados have strong preferences for ribbing and thickness, and I respect that. But for me, itâ€™s all about getting a five-pack of â€˜sumptuously softâ€™ ones from M&S in â€˜grey marlâ€™. The smugness of having only grey socks, and thus being able to pair them up with ease, is a huge bonus. Odd socks arenâ€™t an issue when all your socks match.</p>
<p>8. Buying a new fleece and looking forward to it finally being cold so you can fully appreciate its cosiness.</p>
<p>9. Trying a new brand of milk. Proceed with caution, as sometimes this can be too much excitement. Sainsburyâ€™s swapping your order of Oatly Barista Edition for Califia Farms, fine. Going from almond milk to hemp? Whoa there.</p>
<p>10. Hearing about every single step of someone elseâ€™s skincare routine, despite it fundamentally being the same as everyone elseâ€™s and holding no bearing on your life.</p>
<p>11. Figuring out how to use the grill setting on your oven.</p>
<p>12. A sizeable jar to put household staples in.</p>
<p>13. A label maker. I got one for Christmas a few years back and I continue to find any excuse to make a custom label.</p>
<p>14. Your very own tea station with labelled jars for sugar and teabags, rather than just using the bag each one comes in.</p>
<p>15. Limescale removal. A squeaky clean kettle? The dream.</p>
<p>16. Finding just the right sitting position that delivers both comfort and the ideal light for reading a book.</p>
<p>17. The immense life upgrade of getting a garlic press rather than having to deal with the faff of peeling and chopping.</p>
<p>18. Running a debobbler over a jumper, a sofa arm, a bra strap, everything.</p>
<p>19. Doing the crossword every day.</p>
<p>20. And still doing Wordle (bonus boring points if you have strong opinions about American spellings or words that only those in the US would know)</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>21. And getting really into Connections.</p>
<p>22. An early night.</p>
</div>
<p>23. When you have absolutely zero plans for the evening.</p>

<p>25. Tuning in to watch the weather.</p>
<p>26. Thermals as an entire concept.</p>
<p>27. How much money youâ€™re saving by running a space heater rather than putting the heating on.</p>
<p>28. Pickling anything.</p>
<p>29. Making your own jam.</p>
<p>30. Having a slightly different breakfast than normal. For example, features writer Holly Bullock swapped her usual porridge for a sausage sandwich last Saturday and â€œrode the high all dayâ€. I swapped honey for salted caramel spread on my yoghurt last week and Iâ€™m still thinking about it.</p>
<p>31. Buying the fancy apple juice thatâ€™s cloudy and tastes like actual apples.</p>
<p>32. Nailing your technique for bundling a pair of socks into a little ball.</p>
<p>33. Cheese on toast. Forget making your own pasta or fiddling about with bao buns. Sometimes, some cheddar on sliced white is all the buzz you need.</p>
<p>34. Being asked what you want for Christmas/your birthday and responding by listing off â€˜things for the houseâ€™. Iâ€™d love some new plates.</p>
<p>35. You know whatâ€™s really good? A glass of cold water. Not too cold, mind you. My teeth are sensitive.</p>
<p>36. Discussing how you slept the night before.</p>
<p>37. Buying new bath towels.</p>
<p>38. The lofty dream of having a laundry room, perhaps with one of those drying racks that comes down from the ceiling.</p>
<p>39. A mug with a good weight to it.</p>
<p>40. â€œTidying the edge of my lawn with a lawn edging tool,â€ says <i>Stylist</i>â€™s digital content director Felicity. If I say â€˜edgingâ€™ and you think of lawns, congratulations, you have become boring. Welcome.</p>
<p>41. Fancying someone because they just seem â€˜quite niceâ€™.</p>
<p>42. Other peopleâ€™s office grumbles. â€œSorry for going on and on,â€ they say. No, please do continue to tell me about how Tracy keeps repeating your points in meetings as though sheâ€™s just come up with them. I live for this.</p>
<p>43. Slicing a cross into a jacket potato and watching the steam rise out.</p>
<p>44. â€˜Making good timeâ€™, such as your usual walk to the shop taking seven minutes rather than the allotted 10.</p>
<p>45. Hot water bottles.</p>
<p>46. Growing your own basil because itâ€™s far more cost effective than buying a new pack every time you want to make pesto.</p>
<p>47. Making your own pesto.</p>
<p>48. When it rains and you get the opportunity to try out your new rain cape/umbrella/little detached hood thing.</p>
<p>49. A pleasant light temperature. Iâ€™d like my bulbs to be about 20% warmer, personally.</p>
<p>50. When you press the button at a pedestrian crossing and the lights turn the moment you do. â€œThe feeling of power and tax well spent,â€ says Miranda.</p>
<p>51. <i>The Archers</i> omnibus.</p>
<p>52. When youâ€™re wrapping a present and cut exactly the right amount of paper. Also, when your scissors glide through the paper. Better than hard drugs, some might say.</p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Adobe Stock</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>53. Knowing that youâ€™ve seasoned some fresh tomatoes to perfection. A good quality tomato in general, really.</p>
<p>54. â€œHaving a card drawer so Iâ€™m never caught short,â€ says my most grownup friend, Rebecca.</p>
<p>55. A sharp set of kitchen knives. â€œThereâ€™s a shop down the road from me that sharpens mine a couple of times a year,â€ says <i>Stylist</i>â€™s subeditor, Steven. â€œIâ€™m rarely happier than when slicing a tomato afterwards.â€</p>
<p>56. A nap on a Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>57. When you discover that the dinner you made yesterday microwaves well the next day for lunch.</p>
<p>58. Matches in an aesthetically pleasing box.</p>
<p>59. Or making your own match holder out of an old candle jar by putting it in the freezer, chipping out the wax, and sticking some striking paper on the bottom.</p>
<p>60. Taking the plunge and buying a mini greenhouse.</p>
<p>61. Waking up just before your alarm goes off.</p>
<p>62. A shower, but with enough time for dilly-dallying and general faffing about.</p>
<p>63. Slathering your face in the heaviest cream and the richest oil so you can go to sleep glistening like a chicken about to be roasted.</p>
<p>64. A proper roast chicken, on that note.</p>
<p>65. Batch cooking. Itâ€™s wild how many influencers there are now whose entire schtick is making 10 servings of chilli and popping portions in the freezer.</p>
<p>66. Making a vegetable soup. With odds and ends of veg you didnâ€™t use up!</p>
<p>67. Aiming for <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/30-plants-a-week-challenge/541085" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30 plants a week</a>. I started doing this on <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/eating-over-30-plants-6-month/799551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the guidance of wellbeing queen Miranda Larbi</a>, and now bore everyone by getting out my <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/long-reads/notes-app-psychology/797547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notes app</a> and reading out all the plants Iâ€™ve eaten in the past few days. Even herbs count, you know.</p>
<p>68. Neighbour drama. I heard number 37 doesnâ€™t like how many packages theyâ€™re having to take in for number 39. Itâ€™s a lot of packages, to be fair. Why do they keep ordering stuff for next-day delivery if they know theyâ€™re not going to be in? And donâ€™t get me started on how 39 doesnâ€™t put their green bins back in their gardens in a sufficiently prompt manner.</p>
<p>69. Having a system for your bookshelf organisation. Iâ€™m partial to colour coding, but I recognise this is controversial.</p>
<p>70. The high of watching your total drop thanks to your Nectar card/Tesco clubcard.</p>
<p>71. A cuddle with absolutely zero chance of progression to sex.</p>
<p>72. The moment you successfully excavate an ingrown hair.</p>
<p>73. Coasters. Having a respect for wood: in. Being laissez-faire about water rings: very much out.</p>
<p>74. Any sort of drawer freshening item that makes your underwear smell like lavender.</p>
<p>75. A sensible jumper. A grey crewneck really does go with everything.</p>
<p>76. A spreadsheet that looks good <i>and</i> does a good job at communicating data.</p>
<p>77. A pear at the right point of crispness.</p>
<p>78. Gentle stretches. Not yoga. More like touching your toes or leaning over to one side with your arms above your head.</p>
<p>79. Forget a dramatic will-they-wonâ€™t-they love story or a passionate affair. These days a comforting relationship with someone who makes you laugh and shows they care is the height of hot. Just look at all the swooning over â€˜orange peel theoryâ€™.</p>
<p>80. Leaving a party early enough to stick to your usual bedtime.</p>
<p>81. Iâ€™m considering buying a laser level. No firm decisions have been made yet.</p>
<p>82. Getting stocked up on your preferred pen (Muji 0.38, if youâ€™re wondering).</p>
<p>83. A water flosser.</p>
<p>84. Upgrading to a fancy toothbrush. Mine connects to an app on my phone and tells me when Iâ€™m brushing certain sections of my mouth too hard.</p>
<p>85. A weekend spent reading the newspaper and lying on the sofa.</p>
<p>86. Getting to the end of a pot of a beauty product and getting every last drop left.</p>
<p>87. In fact, the very concept of â€˜getting your moneyâ€™s worthâ€™. Sussing out cost per use, being responsible with your spending and buying things that are made to lastâ€¦ all very boring, all very chic.</p>
<p>88. Putting on a load of laundry or starting a dishwasher cycle.</p>
<p>89. â€œWhen the load of washing Iâ€™ve done is the perfect amount to all fit on the clothes horse,â€ says head of email Annie Simpson, â€œso I donâ€™t have random socks and T-shirts hanging off drawers and cupboards.â€</p>
<p>90. Managing the delicate art of poaching an egg for a runny yolk but sufficiently firm whites.</p>
<p>91. Receiving a present, unwrapping it and saving the paper for future use.</p>
<p>92. <i>Stylist</i>â€™s social media editor Sophie Boyden says her heated clothes dryer is â€œlife-changingâ€. I am deeply envious.</p>
<p>93. Did you know that rice pudding sales jumped by 45% last year? And that a rice pudding bar, named Rizz Rice (yes, that does make us all uncomfortable, but letâ€™s move on), opened up in London in February? Rice pudding, the dullest of desserts, is having its time in the sun.</p>
<p>94. Ordering a big food shop and discovering the expiry date on a perishable item is later than you had predicted. A thrill!</p>
<p>95. Landing the coveted front seat on the upper deck of the bus so you can feel like youâ€™re driving.</p>
<p>96. A simple sandwich. Look, I have all the time in the world for a hyped-up <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/food-drink/best-sandwiches-london/784838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XXL sandwich</a> filled with fancy pickles and exciting textures, but alsoâ€¦ an egg mayo is quite good, isnâ€™t it?</p>
<p>97. Successfully unclogging a big wad of hair from the plughole.</p>
<p>98. A crisp spring day. Does this offer the excitement of a snow day or the sex appeal of sweltering summer climes? Absolutely not. But the crispness of the air is plain magical.</p>
<p>99. Having an hour to do a deep extracting session in front of a magnifying mirror.</p>
<p>100. An uneventful day/week/month where nothing really happens. Things are always <i>happening</i>. Thereâ€™s always something. Wouldnâ€™t a brief respite from that be absolutely delicious?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One in 10 women in the UK live with <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/women/endometriosis-types-stages/800879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">endometriosis</a>, but youâ€™d be forgiven for assuming the true number was much smaller with the lack of knowledge, awareness and respect the condition receives. </p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/women/endometriosis-diagnosis-waiting-times-increase-report/869348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waiting almost a decade</a> to get a diagnosis to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/endometriosis-treatment-pregnant-advice/867534" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being told getting pregnant</a> is the best option for managing symptoms, living with endometriosis often feels like dealing with one blow after another. And thatâ€™s on top of the toll that the condition itself can take. In a recent survey from <a href="https://www.activeiron.com/uk/all-products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Iron</a>, 96% of women with endometriosis said their symptoms had led to a decline in their quality of life.</p>
<p>But while progress is slow on the societal front, the endo community remains home to a wealth of advice for dealing with painful symptoms, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/5-women-endometriosis-diagnosis/866901" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GP appointments</a> and everything in between.  </p>
<p>So, to mark Endometriosis Awareness Month this March, we asked five women who are living with endometriosis to share their advice for dealing with painful flare-ups. From using meditation to regulate stress to keeping an eye on posture, hereâ€™s what they said.Â Â </p>
<h3>â€œStress makes my symptoms worse, so I practise meditationâ€ </h3>
<p>â€œFlares are one of the worst parts of having endo, but Iâ€™ve found a few things that help to manage them at home. The most important one is reducing my stress through <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/daily-meditation-10-minutes-every-day/492763" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meditating</a> â€“ the more I stress, the worse the flare-up gets.  </p>
<p>â€œAfter that, I like to combine fresh ginger and lemon to make an anti-inflammatory tea and reduce all processed foods in my diet for the next few days to help my body settle down. Tens machines are also a great way to reduce the pain without taking medication.â€ </p>
<p><b>Sophie, 27Â </b></p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>â€œI try not to sit at my desk for too longâ€ </h3>
<p>â€œSince I noticed sitting at my desk for too long could trigger a flare-up and worsen my pain, Iâ€™ve started looking at home to improve my posture and desk set-up as well as building in time to walk around and move. Having in-person meetings and moving around more during the day seems to lead to fewer flare-ups and less pain â€“ itâ€™s hard to know the cause here but it has worked for me. </p>
<p>â€œI also use a variety of methods to help keep my pain under control. Heat can be a very effective form of pain relief so I have a lavender wheat bag I can pop in the microwave as well as heat pads that go directly on my skin. I also have cooling pads for when the pain feels hot and angry.</p>
<p>â€œIâ€™ve recently started to use breathwork as a way to â€˜breathe outâ€™ the pain. Iâ€™m no specialist, but because the pain can cause my body to tense up, Iâ€™ve found using my breathing to try to relax and visualise the pain leaving my body to be really effective alongside other things.</p>
<p>â€œLearning techniques from a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/pelvic-health-strengthen-pelvic-floor-feel-better/592698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pelvic floor</a> physio has also helped me to manage flare-ups and manage my condition in general. I also use teas and fresh ingredients to help calm and soothe any gut-related symptoms I have during a flare-up.â€</p>
<p><b>Rebekah, 33Â </b></p>
<h3>â€œNothing takes the pain away, so I take the weight off my feetâ€ </h3>
<p>â€œIâ€™ve suffered with endometriosis since I was a teenager, and every time the pain flares up again I feel so frustrated and disappointed with my body. <i>Really? This again?</i> I say to myself as I feel it shooting through my pelvis, in my lower back and the tops of my legs.  </p>
<p>â€œI feel like after so many years, I should have found a better way to manage it, but nothing Iâ€™ve tried can fully take the pain away. I usually have a hot bath or hot water bottle to just about take the edge off and take the weight off my feet until I can ride it out.â€ </p>
<p><b>Martha, 40Â </b></p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>â€œNatural alternatives have been really helpfulâ€ </h3>
<p>â€œI was diagnosed with endometriosis at 18 and underwent a medically induced and reversed menopause to treat the condition (after a major operation), so I was keen to try natural alternatives where possible after all the medical interventions.  </p>
<p>â€œI went to the health food shop where the lady gave me all sorts of weird and wonderful ingredients to mix into a tea, and I found it really helped. I later retrained as a tea sommelier and began making my own teas, which I still use to support my body and symptoms. </p>
<p>â€œI also sell these teas to other women looking for natural support through <a href="https://mothercuppatea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my small business</a>. The teas contain ingredients Iâ€™ve found to be personally beneficial â€“ my energise blend, for example, contains <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/ashwagandha-herb-stress-ayurveda-stress-relief-anxiety/759010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ashwagandha</a>, an adaptogen plant that helps the body to adapt to stress, as well as ginger, which Iâ€™ve found helps with period cramps.â€ </p>
<p><b>Candice, 41</b></p>
<h3>â€œSelf-compassion helps me to navigate the guilt of cancelling plansâ€ </h3>
<p>â€œI do lots of practical things to deal with my pain â€“ taking painkillers, using hot water bottles. But one of the most important things Iâ€™ve learned is to be kind to myself.</p></p>
<p>â€œThere is so much emotional pain that goes along with being an endo sufferer â€“ not only is it rarely acknowledged by doctors, but that feeling when you know that your body is having a flare-up and youâ€™ll have to cancel plans can leave you feeling guilty and a bit rubbish. We need to remember that itâ€™s out of our control and that endometriosis is such a debilitating condition. People will understand â€“ we need to try and offer the same sympathy to ourselves.</p>
<p>â€œTalking to other people about what youâ€™re going through also helps. Youâ€™ll be surprised by how many women will identify with your pain, and it may even be the catalyst that someone needs to get their own diagnosis.â€</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week weâ€™re hearing from Julia Sands, an accredited practitioner of the Institute for Outdoor Learning and founder of <a href="https://www.ipsewilderness.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ipse Wilderness</a>.Â </p>
<p><b>Hey, Julia! If you could recommend One Good Thing everyone can do to improve their mental health, what would it be?</b></p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/walking-mental-health-benefits/471657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">daily 15-minute walk</a> in green (or blue) space, ie in a park, woodland or any kind of space with views of nature and/or water.</p>
<p><b>Why is this your One Good Thing?</b></p>
<p>Multiple studies have found a causal link between exercise in nature and a reduced risk of mental health problems, improved mood, lower stress, increased life satisfaction and eudaimonic wellbeing.</p>
<p><b>How can we use a daily walk for our mental health?</b></p>
<p>Go outside, move your body, look around and take notice. Even if you canâ€™t walk far, spending time in nature is restful and restorative because it provides â€˜soft fascinationâ€™: pleasant things to notice that donâ€™t require our effort. <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JPMH-02-2021-0029/full/html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studies have proved</a> that walking in woodland and noticing three good things in nature each day (eg hearing birdsong or watching leaves sway in the wind) has a significantly positive impact on mental wellbeing after just five days, including for those with a specific mental health diagnosis such as depression or anxiety.</p>
<section class="pp-article__boxout">
<div id="boxout_1" class="pp-boxout" style="background-color:#606060;">
<div class="pp-boxout__body">
<h4>Avoid taking your phone or listening to music. Just be.</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p class=""><b>What benefits could we see from a walk that includes that soft fascination?</b></p>
<p>A reduction in depression and anxiety. An improvement in psychological wellbeing, enhanced mood, increased self-esteem and reduced tension. The physical health benefits include reduced blood pressure, cardiovascular fitness and reduced inflammation. Facilitation of social networking and connectivity. And you can learn more about your neighbourhood and find new places to walk.</p>
<p><b>Are there any common mistakes people make when heading out for their walk? How can we avoid them?</b></p>
<p>Sometimes itâ€™s tempting to use a walk as a way to ruminate, worry or plan. Try to avoid taking your phone or listening to music. Just be. Look around and label to yourself what you can notice about nature around you. It can help to walk with someone else and point out the nice things you notice to them.</p>
<p><b>How do you personally do your One Good Thing?</b></p>
<p>I got a dog five years ago specifically to force myself to go for a walk every day. I am easily distracted so I list the things I notice out loud to myself as I walk. I also try to take a moment to really appreciate something on each walk, whether itâ€™s the crunch of the frost underfoot or the shape of the clouds.</p>
<p><b>And how has doing this changed your life for the better?</b></p>
<p>I am definitely fitter and emotionally more calm. Plus, I became a qualified Lowland Leader so I now lead other people on wellbeing walks in nature with Ipse Wilderness.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As much as I love going back to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/film/romantic-comedy-films-2023/752500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">romcom</a>Â classics such as <i>How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days</i> and <i>The Proposal</i>, itâ€™s always exciting to treat yourself to a brand new romcom â€“ where you donâ€™t know the ending or half the script. Prime Video has already released a sweet and funny romcom this year, Camila Mendesâ€™ <i>Upgraded,Â </i>and the streamer has now announced that another one is on its way.</p>
<p><i>Picture This</i> is all about how far we go to find love and the hilarious stories we pick up along the way. The best part? <i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/tv/bridgerton-season-3-netflix-cast-release-date-plot/659243" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bridgerton</a></i>â€™s Simone Ashley will be taking the lead. So, hereâ€™s everything we know so far about<i> Picture This</i>.</p>
<h2><b>What is the plot of <i>Picture This</i>?</b></h2>
<p>Pia is as single as they come and is trying to keep her failing photography studio afloat in London with her best friend, Jay. â€œAs her sister Sonal prepares to get married and her mother Laxmi urges the resolutely independent Pia to partner up, a spiritual guru at Sonalâ€™s engagement party predicts Pia will meet the love of her life among the next five dates she goes on.</p>
<p>As her family intervenes, setting her up on a series of increasingly desperate blind dates, Pia begins a hilarious but heartfelt quest for real love,â€ reads the synopsis.</p>
<h2><b>Who will star in <i>Picture This</i>?</b></h2>
<p>Simone Ashley stars as Pia and Hero Fiennes Tiffin (<i>After</i>) as, what we can only assume, her love interest.</p>
<p>Further cast includes Phil Dunster (<i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/ted-lasso" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ted Lasso</a></i>), Nikesh Patel (<i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/starstruck-season-3-bbc-three-cast-trailer-release-date/671141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starstruck</a></i>), Adil Ray (<i>Citizen Khan</i>), Sindhu Vee (<i>Matilda: The Musical</i>), Anoushka Chadha (<i>You</i>), Kulvinder Ghir (<i>Bend It Like Beckham</i>) and Luke Fetherston (<i>Still Up</i>).</p>
<p>The film is directed by Prarthana Mohan, written by Nikita Lalwani and is based on the Australian original film, <i>Five Blind Dates</i>.</p>
<h2><b>When will <i>Picture This </i>be released?</b></h2>
<p>The film is currently in post-production so weâ€™re hoping we might get to see it some time this year.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/working-from-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Working from home</a> sounded like our type on paper when we all got sent home in lockdown, but it has proven all too easy to get really, really tiresome if we donâ€™t make sure our day has some structure to it.Â </p>
<p>What do we mean by this? Well, we need to make sure we start and finish at set times, that we get dressed, that we take proper lunchbreaks, and that we give our brain the space it needs to breathe every so often.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s lots of ways to do this, of course. You could take a walk round the block at the start and end of each day. You could set an alarm at 12:30, reminding you to go cook yourself some lunch and sit in a different room for a little while. Or you could rely on regularly scheduled <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/netflix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a> breaks to lure you away from your home office (which, if we might be so bold to say, looks an awful lot like you took your laptop to bed with you).</p>
<p>Oh yes, Netflix reigns supreme when it comes to improving a WFH day and there are plenty of shorter feel-good options available. And, because we care about bringing a little joy to your life, weâ€™ve looked up all those sitcoms, animations and comedies which boast episodes of 30 minutes or less.</p>
<p>Happy viewing.</p>

This show, though, focuses on her life after her time in the cult, as she reclaims her life by venturing to New York and moving into a flatshare with Titus Andromedas, a gay wannabe Broadway actor. Her wide-eyed enthusiasm as she gets to grips with everyday life? Itâ€™s a recipe for the ultimate feel-good show.</p>

Thereâ€™s Lana Kane, one of the top field agents in the International Secret Intelligence Service â€“ and a working mother, to boot, thanks to her insemination by sperm donor. And thereâ€™s Mallory Archer, a former super-spy who manages the entire operation from her luxurious office â€“ when sheâ€™s not sleeping with the head of the KGB, and Bert Reynolds, or, you know, anyone else who takes her fancy.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since May 2023, UK voters have had to show a government-accepted form of photo ID at polling stations to vote in person at most elections. The voting ID rule was introduced in April 2022 through the Elections Act 2022, which brought in voter identification in the UK for the first time. The government claimed that new rules were needed to prevent votes from being stolen or fraudulent, even though the UK has never had a significant problem with voter fraud.</p>
<p>Knowing what documents youâ€™ll need to bring to the polling station can be confusing at the best of times, so weâ€™ve broken down the big questions around voter ID so that you feel prepared to cast your vote.</p>
<h2><b>What are the voter ID rules?</b></h2>
<p>Not all elections or voting methods will require you to show identification. The rules apply to:</p>
<ul>
<li>All local elections in England</li>
<li>Mayoral elections, as well as the London Assembly</li>
<li>All by-elections and referendums in England</li>
<li>Police and crime commissioner elections in England and Wales</li>
<li>General elections</li>
</ul>
<p>You wonâ€™t need to present your ID if youâ€™re voting by post or if youâ€™re voting in local elections in Scotland and Wales or voting for the Scottish or Welsh parliament.</p>
<h2><b>What can I use as a photo ID?</b></h2>
<p>The Electoral Commission lists <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/voting-and-elections/voter-id/accepted-forms-photo-id" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22 acceptable forms of identification</a>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passport</li>
<li>Driving licence</li>
<li>Local travel passes for disabled and older people (60+)</li>
<li>Biometric immigration document </li>
</ul>
<p>The ID has to be the original and not a photocopy but you can use an out-of-date version as long as you look the same in your photo.</p>
<h2><b>What happens if I donâ€™t have a valid form of photo ID?</b></h2>
<p>Anyone registered to vote without an accepted form of identification can apply for a free document known as a <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/voting-and-elections/voter-id/applying-a-voter-authority-certificate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Voter Authority Certificate</a>. You donâ€™t need this certificate if youâ€™re voting by post, only if youâ€™re planning on casting your vote in person.</p>
<p>The application is online (or by post) and when applying for a Voter Authority Certificate, you will need to provide your: name, address, date of birth and national insurance number. Youâ€™ll also need to submit a photo to obtain a certificate. Thereâ€™s more information on the Electoral Commissionâ€™s website but the requirements for the photo are similar to what youâ€™d need for a passport photo.</p>
<p>The deadline to apply for free voter ID for the elections on Thursday 2 May is 5pm on Wednesday 24 April.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On any given day, my journey to work can feel more like a game of Buckaroo than a commute. Although I possess a smart-ish leather bag, by the time Iâ€™ve thrown in the dayâ€™s essentials, itâ€™s pretty much at capacity. When it comes to adding in any virtuous extras (packed lunch, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/pilates-fitness-challenge-2-weeks-pilates-challenge/678576" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pilates</a> kit, change of clothing, make-up bag), I file them carefully into a cotton tote and rely on pockets for smaller items. Any semblance of order is quickly gone, and I am patting myself down at the bus stop, wondering which receptacle contains the wallet I had five minutes earlier. If the  frazzled Englishwoman has a discernible street style, then this is surely it. </p>
<p>How is it 2024 and Iâ€™m still relying on a coterie of tote bags to carry me through the working day? Now in my late 20s, I need to find a streamlined solution to this game of sartorial logistics. While <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/why-uniqlo-crossbody-popular/797670" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the viral Uniqlo Universal bag</a>Â might have been perfect for festivals and holidays, it definitely wasnâ€™t capacious enough for a working personâ€™s daily essentials. So why does a properly sized bag feel so hard to find? We can blame, in part, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/old-school-fashion-explained/798287" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the rise of Y2K fashion</a> and its micro baguette bags. But this is changing, thankfully. â€œWeâ€™re seeing a huge obsession with oversized XXL bags at the moment,â€ says Kate Devlin, assistant trends editor at <i>Stylus</i>. â€œWhile weâ€™ve been out of the pandemic for a while now, itâ€™s only recently that weâ€™ve started to see this huge push for people to go back into the office and to be out and about more. From apparel to footwear to bags, this is fuelling a trend towards practicality and pragmatism.â€Â </p>

<h4>They allow for both novelty and practicality</h4>
<p></p>
</div>

<p>Yet such bags donâ€™t have to be boring. Bottega Veneta, the Italian luxury fashion house has driven an aesthetic that tends towards slouchy, oversized shoulder bags in woven <i>intrecciato</i> leather. Elsewhere, fashionable figures such as the Olsen twins have been seen carrying beaten-up HermÃ¨s Birkins with all of their belongings. While Telfar has become another viral favourite for its practical yet fashionable vegan leather bags, often with design collabs in the mix. Brands such as Loewe, Goyard and Miu Miu have been cashing in on the luxury tote sector for years. â€œTheyâ€™re a garment that allows for both novelty and practicality,â€ adds Devlin. </p>
<p>Yet according to Tessa Litchfield, a senior private shopper at Matches Fashion, the most zeitgeisty XL bag right now  is The Rowâ€™s Margaux. â€œDeemed by some as the new Birkin,â€ she says, â€œinfluencers are wearing them under their arm like a clutch. Even though they are huge, itâ€™s a cool aesthetic and wonâ€™t wear out the straps if you have it loaded up with a laptop.â€ Having spawned a legion of knock-offs on the high street, its colourways, available in both black and browns, makes it suitable for â€œpreppy girls as much as boho babesâ€.</p>
<p>When it comes to selecting your own <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/capacious-bags/775866" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">day-to-day work bag</a>, Litchfield suggests first considering the practicalities. â€œWhether itâ€™s a trans-seasonal piece youâ€™re after or something to last you through winter and summer, think about your lifestyle. If youâ€™re getting on the Tube, I wouldnâ€™t go for something light coloured.â€ Yet she also suggests seeing it as an investment piece: if itâ€™s something you will use every day, it needs the quality to match. Ultimately, a good, durable bag is something every working person needs, regardless of age or lifestyle. â€œEven Gen Z girls in my office need to bring their laptops to work,â€ says Litchfield. â€œThey might have their mini handbags, but then theyâ€™ll have a tote bag from Marks & Spencer, too.â€ </p>
<p>Here, we bring you 12 day-to-day bags that will hold everything you need (and maybe even more).Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Springâ€™s finally here, with the evenings drawing out a little and daffodils and blossom in full bloom. Having that bit more daylight can have a radical impact on our mood and energy, as well as our appetite for some fresh and colourful food. </p>
<p>This gorgeous beetroot recipe makes the perfect spring brunch. And itâ€™s as nourishing as it is aesthetically pleasing: <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/food/boost-athletic-performance-gut-health-beetroot-soup-recipe/741172" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beetroot</a> is packed with nutrients and its benefits range from helping to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27278926/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lower blood pressure</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5295087/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improve athletic performance</a> to having powerful <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8565237/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-oxidant properties</a> that may help to ward off disease. </p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that the tabbouleh, along with providing some texture, is a great source of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/fibre-health-benefits/408155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fibre</a>, while a scattering of pumpkin and sunflower seeds gives our <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/gut" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gut health</a> a boost, too.Â </p>

<p>â€œThis Scottish beetroot and pearl barley tabbouleh is the perfect healthy springtime brunch,â€ says Clare Coghill, chef and founder of <a href="https://www.cafecuil.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CafÃ© CÃ¹il</a>.Â </p>
<p>â€œThis recipe serves two, but I recommend doubling or tripling it up to store in the fridge and use as a quick and easy meal prep for the rest of the week. The pearl barley provides slow-release energy, while the mix of herbs, vegetables, seeds and grains have loads of healthy benefits.â€</p>
<h3>For the beetroot</h3>
<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1 large beetroot</li>
<li>1 tsp miso paste</li>
<li>1 tbsp Scottish honey (or use maple syrup to make it vegan)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Method</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Peel your beetroot, and boil in a pan until tender.</li>
<li>Remove from the water and allow to cool, before chopping into rough wedges.</li>
<li>Melt your honey (or maple) and miso paste together in a pot on the hob over a low heat.</li>
<li>Add your wedges of beetroot, and toss in the sauce until evenly coated and sticky.</li>
<li>Remove from the pot.</li>
</ol>
<h3>For the tabbouleh</h3>
<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<ul>
<li>150g pearl barley</li>
<li>1 leaf of spring greens, roughly chopped</li>
<li>Bunch of parsley, finely chopped</li>
<li>Bunch of mint, finely chopped</li>
<li>Cherry tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
<li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
<li>Handful of toasted sunflower or pumpkin seeds</li>
<li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Method</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Rinse your pearl barley thoroughly, before adding to a large saucepan with 500ml of cold, salted water.</li>
<li>Bring the water to a boil, and boil for 10 minutes. Reduce to a simmer and cook for a further 45 minutes. Once cooked to al dente, drain the water and add the pearl barley back to the pot, but keep it off the heat.</li>
<li>Add in your roughly chopped spring greens and tomatoes, your finely chopped parsley and mint (leaving some aside to garnish with at the end), the juice of a lemon, and a healthy glug of olive oil. Toss until incorporated and season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Leave to cool to room temperature before serving.</li>
<li>Top your tabbouleh mix with your sweet and savoury wedges of beetroot and sprinkle with fresh parsley, mint and pumpkin or sunflower seeds.</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring may have sprung but the unpredictable showers and fleeting sunshine still have us dreaming of escapes to warmer shores.</p>
<p>And while we all love a city break full of sightseeing and exploration, thereâ€™s something particularly decadent about a holiday spent mostly horizontally.Â </p>
<p>Lying by the pool. Lying on the beach. Floating on a lilo. Sleeping in without guilt. All perfectly respectable holiday pastimes that just donâ€™t feel as luxurious in the UK, even when weâ€™re blessed with good weather.</p>
<p>Luckily for you, thereâ€™s no need to suffer through a long-haul flight to get your slice of holiday heaven. In fact, weâ€™ve found a crop of European gems that will have you donning sunnies and shorts in under four hours.Â </p>
<p>So, if youâ€™re looking for a break thatâ€™s positively frivolous, below is our edit of the best spots to enjoy a lazy girl holiday in Europe this summerâ€¦</p>
<h2>Phaea Blue Palace, Elounda, Crete</h2><div class="iframely-instagram iframely-app iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="Blue Palace on Instagram: &quot;Soak up the scenery!

<p>Start your days nibbling fresh fruit and eating made-to-order Cretan omelette at the terrace restaurant and spend your afternoons lounging by either of two pools or on the private beach. If youâ€™re feeling adventurous, a traditional caÃ¯que boat trip is a must for expansive views of the glittering Aegean Sea.</p>

<p>Yoga, Pilates, tennis and a wellness suite (complete with spa and sauna) cater for those who like to stay active during their down time while resident DJs and live bands set the mood with uplifting beats. You can even graze on street food and Ã  la carte dishes without leaving your lounger â€“ simply order via your smartphone. If thatâ€™s not lazy girl luxury, we donâ€™t know what is.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my mind, workday dressing should be a wonderful ritual that sets you up for the day. The reality is that I spend an hour lovingly doing my daughterâ€™s hair, carefully washing her face and helping her pick out her perfect pink-on-pink outfit. Afterwards, a scrappy four minutes remain for me to throw on anything clean and vaguely presentable.  </p>
</p>
<p>I think about clothes all the time â€“ obviously, thatâ€™s my job â€“ and Iâ€™ve been trying to move away from a formulaic way of dressing to something more creative and joyful. But, you know what? 7.55am on a Monday calls for formulaic; itâ€™s all my busy mind and schedule can take at that time.  </p>
</p>
<p>So, I am pleased to report that Iâ€™ve finally cracked it. The perfect workwear formula that works every time. Itâ€™s based on three core elements that I am reasonably confident most of us already have in our wardrobes. And if you donâ€™t? Buying them will be a smart investment for your sanity.  </p>
</p>
<p>First up, the core of the outfit is a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/best-wide-leg-trousers/862847" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wide-leg trouser</a>. We have talked about these so much at <i>Stylist</i> recently and the reason isâ€¦ they are fabulous. Smart yet relaxed. They mean business but are of the moment. And crucially, theyâ€™re comfy. I bought a pair from The Frankie Shop in December and I wear them three times a week, maybe four. Cost per wear, you canâ€™t fault them. Theyâ€™re black, high-waisted and have a pleated front. Cos also has a brilliant pair â€“ see below.Â </p></p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Cos WIDE-LEG TAILORED TWILL TROUSERS" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2024/03/22152535/screenshot-2024-03-22-at-15-25-14-844x844.png">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Cos</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><b>Cos</b></p>
<p><i><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=rMkN3u4Plxg&mid=47832&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cos.com%2Fen_gbp%2Fwomen%2Fwomenswear%2Ftops%2Fproduct.merino-wool-knitted-tank-top-beige.1158998003.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Merino wool knitted top, Â£35</a></i></p>
<p><i><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=rMkN3u4Plxg&mid=47832&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cos.com%2Fen_gbp%2Fwomen%2Faccessories%2Fbelts%2Fproduct.classic-leather-belt-black.1097485003.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Classic leather belt, Â£45</a></i></p>
<p><i><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=rMkN3u4Plxg&mid=47832&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cos.com%2Fen_gbp%2Fwomen%2Fwomenswear%2Ftrousers%2Fproduct.wide-leg-tailored-twill-trousers-black.1226602001.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wide-leg tailored trousers, Â£95</a></i></p>
<p>Then with this core trouser you need to wear a basic top. Depending on the type of day you have in front of you, this could be a crisp white T-shirt, an oversized shirt, a v-neck knit or a slimline cardigan. All of the above will work with minimal fuss â€“ just pick what works best for you. If your office requires a smarter outfit, opt for a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/best-womens-shirt-to-buy-now/821263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">masculine shirt</a> tucked in and wear with square-toe loafers. You can even add a blazer if you wish. If your office is more informal, a T-shirt and bright retro trainers will look slick.Â </p>
</p>
<p>And the final piece of the magic wardrobe puzzle is a belt. When some of my chicest friends started to wear belts again after many years in the sartorial wilderness, I was unconvinced. But, as ever, they were right and a slim leather belt with a metal buckle is the quickest way to elevate a simple look for the workday. It pulls together two simple basics and turns them into something more.Â </p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/chalk-pink-tailoring-shop-now/871696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">workwear</a> formula has got me through the first three months of 2024, and I plan to utilise it for the rest of the year. So my advice is: buy yourself a belt. It will update your simple separates in an instant. You wonâ€™t regret it.Â Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The horror genre has experienced something of a revival in recent years, with cult classics includingÂ <i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/film/scream-6-fan-theories/753896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scream</a></i>,<i>Â The Exorcist</i> and <i>The Addams Family</i> all being reimagined for contemporary audiences via sequels and spin-offs. Last spring, Warner Bros announced that a sequel to Tim Burtonâ€™s 1988 filmÂ <i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/beetlejuice-film-review-netflix-winona-ryder-michael-keaton-80s-classic/375466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beetlejuice</a>Â </i>was in the works (aptly named <i>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</i>).</p>
<p>The first snippet of info we got about the film was last month, when Jenna Ortega, star of Netflixâ€™s <i>Wednesday</i>, revealed she was taking a starring role.Â </p>
<p>â€œI donâ€™t know how much Iâ€™m allowed to say, but I am Lydia Deetzâ€™s daughter, so Iâ€™ll give that away,â€ Ortega revealed in an interview with <i><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/jenna-ortega-2024-hollywood-portfolio-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a></i>. </p>
<p>Played by Winona Ryder, Lydia Deetz was the character at the heart of the original <i>Beetlejuice </i>film. A teenage goth who can see ghosts, Lydia has more than a little in common with Wednesday Addams, the role that catapulted Ortega to global fame back in 2022.Â </p>
<p>In a full-circle moment, <i>Wednesday</i> was also directed by Tim Burton, who has returned to direct the <i>Beetlejuice</i> sequel.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s everything else we know about the repriseâ€¦Â </p>
<h2>Who is starring in <i>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</i>?Â </h2>
<p>Fans of the original will be thrilled to learn that Michael Keaton is reprising the role of Beetlejuice himself, while Winona Ryder returns as Lydia Deetz and Jenna Ortega will take on the role of Lydiaâ€™s teenage daughter, Astrid.Â </p>
<p>Astrid is â€œweird, but in a different way and not in the way youâ€™d assumeâ€, Ortega said on the role, adding that her characterâ€™s relationship with Lydia will be a â€œvery importantâ€ part of the upcoming film. </p>
<p>While Astrid wonâ€™t be seen â€œwearing pink and [being] a cheerleaderâ€, she will want to push â€œagainst [her] momâ€™s history or pastâ€, Ortega said: â€œAny kid who becomes a teenager wants to be removed from their parents. I think they instantly just fight whatever it is that their parent loves.â€Â </p>
<p>As a result, Lydia and Astrid will â€œbutt heads quite a bitâ€ in the film, she continued.Â </p>
<p>The brilliant Catherine Oâ€™Hara (<i>Schittâ€™s Creek</i>) also returns in her role as Lydiaâ€™s step-mother Delia Deetz, while new cast members will be introduced including Justin Theroux (<i>Star Wars: Episode VIII â€“ The Last Jedi</i>), Monica Bellucci (<i>Spectre, The Matrix</i>), Arthur Conti (<i>House Of The Dragon</i>) and Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe (<i>Poor Things, At Eternityâ€™s Gate</i>).</p>
<p class="stylist-youtube"><div class="iframely-youtube iframely-player iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="BEETLEJUICE BEETLEJUICE - Official Teaser Trailer - Warner Bros. UK &amp; Ireland" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/S0SO0mq?maxheight=1200" data-img allowfullscreen scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture *; web-share *;"></iframe></div></div></p><h2>What is the plot of <i>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</i>?Â </h2>
<p>The film will again be set in the fictional town of Winter River in Connecticut. When an unexpected family tragedy occurs, three generations of the Deetz family return home.  Still haunted by Beetlejuice, Lydiaâ€™s life is turned upside down when her rebellious teenage daughter, Astrid, discovers the mysterious model of the town in the attic and the portal to the Afterlife is accidentally opened.  With trouble brewing in both realms, itâ€™s only a matter of time until someone says Beetlejuiceâ€™s name three times and the mischievous demon returns to unleash his very own brand of mayhem.</p>
<p>Tim Burton returns to direct the film, alongside <i>Wednesday</i> screenplay writers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar.Â </p>
<h2>When does <i>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</i> come out?Â </h2>
<p>It looks like we donâ€™t have to wait <i>too</i>Â long to get our fix, as the film will hit UK cinemas on 6 September 2024.Â </p>
<p>The original <i>Beetlejuice </i>film was a critical and commercial success, grossing US$74.7 million (Â£60m) from a budget of just $15 million (Â£12m). It followed a deceased couple who enlist a spirit named Beetlejuice to help them rid their home of its new inhabitants.Â </p>
<p>In a new interview, Keaton said that he and Burton were initially nervous about making a <i>Beetlejuice </i>sequel, but it was worth it in the end.</p>
<p>â€œWe thought, â€˜You got to get this right. Otherwise, just donâ€™t do it. Letâ€™s just go on with our lives and do other things.â€™ So I was hesitant and cautious, and [Burton] was probably equally as hesitant and cautious over all these years,â€ he <a href="https://people.com/michael-keaton-teases-beetlejuice-sequel-enormous-fun-exclusive-8584898" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <i>People </i>magazine</a>. â€œOnce we got there, I said, â€˜OK, letâ€™s just go for it. Letâ€™s just see if we can do it, if we can pull this off.â€™â€</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might have seen videos of the preppy bob doing the rounds; like so many other things in your beauty routine and wardrobe, itâ€™s a style thatâ€™s inspired by Hailey Bieber.</p>
<p>But more than that, itâ€™s a style thatâ€™s ideal if youâ€™re at the stage where you feel like your hair needs a break, whether thatâ€™s from regular heat styling, colour or something else entirely. â€œItâ€™s a mid-neck, jaw-skimming sort of cut thatâ€™s designed to be understyled,â€ says <a href="https://adamreed.london/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Reed</a>, founder of <a href="https://arkiveheadcare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arkive Headcare</a>.</p>
<p>â€œIâ€™ve seen various iterations of this sort of cut trending since the spring, and while it is a version of Hailey Bieberâ€™s style, the thing thatâ€™s nice about it is that itâ€™s so undone that you really donâ€™t need to over-do it with styling,â€ explains Reed.Â </p>
<h2>How to get the preppy bob look</h2>
<p>If itâ€™s a style youâ€™re thinking of getting, Reed says you should ask your stylist for a â€œmid-neck, jaw-skimming shapeâ€ and then make sure that thereâ€™s some softness added around the front, so the cut is working to help contour your face. â€œThen the weight of the hair needs reducing â€“ thatâ€™s something thatâ€™ll be personalised for each individual â€“ but thatâ€™s what will give it a slightly grungy, worn-in feel,â€ he adds.</p>
<div class="iframely-instagram iframely-app iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="Hailey Rhode Baldwin Bieber on Instagram: &quot;Bonjour ðŸŽ€&quot;" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/YZzEPp5?maxheight=1200&app=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Another thing thatâ€™s great about the preppy bob is that itâ€™s not a high-maintenance cut by any stretch. Reed even suggests going a little bit shorter and then you can let it grow through for longer. â€œThe key is that youâ€™re really not doing that much to it at all, and if your hair is in good condition to start with then this sort of style will allow it to stay that way.â€</p>
<p>When it comes to styling, less is more. â€œItâ€™s supposed to look groomed rather than rigidly styled,â€ says Reed. â€œMy recommendation is to use shampoo and conditioner as normal, and interchange that with masks every few washes. Then you can work a hydrating cream â€“ like <a href="https://tidd.ly/3SscFNY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arkiveâ€™s The Good Calmer, Â£13</a>, into damp hair. I like to comb it through to ensure even distribution, and then let it dry naturally or use a diffuser; not to create a curl but just to dry it off.â€</p>
<p>And there we have it: the ultimate low-maintenance, on-trend style thatâ€™s loved by Hailey Bieber. Consider us sold.Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>High street giant H&Mâ€™s designer collaborations are renowned among fashion fans. In fact, the limited edition capsule collections are known to sell out within seconds, causing website crashes and in-store queues coming out of shop doors. But joining the line-up of famous luxury labels â€“ including Rabanne, Simone Rocha, Moschino and Erdem â€“ is an emerging designer whoâ€™s relatively unknown compared to the partnerships who have come before. </p>
<p>Named Rokh, after creative director Rok Hwang (who used to work under <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/phoebe-philo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoebe Philo</a> as ready-to-wear designer at Celine), the emerging label is â€œadmired for its experimental spins on <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/best-new-in-fashion-wishlist/639190" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wardrobe staples</a>â€, according to H&M. The brand has already been worn by some key celebrities, including Blackpinkâ€™s Jennie and Jisoo, Korean actor Han So-hee, Sydney Sweeney, Irina Shayk and Lucy Hale, to name only a few. Partnering withÂ H&M is likely to launch Rokh into the limelight, propelling it from a fashion insider favourite to a household name.Â </p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Rokh x H&M</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Speaking about the collaboration, Rok Hwang says: â€œRokh designs have a classic appearance with a radical construction for a timeless approach to design. Iâ€™m very excited to share our vision with more customers around the world thanks to this milestone collection with H&M.â€</p>
<p>Ann-Sofie Johansson, creative advisor and head of design womenswear at H&M, added: â€œRokh is at the forefront of a new wave of Korean designers whose conceptual yet wearable clothes are captivating fashion right now. Weâ€™re proud to present a curated edit of designer Rok Hwangâ€™s adaptable wardrobe classics, and we canâ€™t wait to see how our customers wear them.â€</p>
<p>The curated edit is rumoured to be a 58-piece collection launching in-store at select locations and online at H&M on 18 April. Hero pieces will include Rokhâ€™s signature styles, such as a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/best-trench-coats-women-beige-black-belted-shop-online/293770" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">double-layer trench coat</a>, detachable-hem dresses, corset-style pieces, office-ready bags and statement jewellery. So, weâ€™ll certainly have our shopping bags at the ready.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It can be a tricky thing trying to balance comedic elements with a suspenseful <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/tv/best-thriller-series-2024/856607" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thriller</a>Â but ITVâ€™s new series, <i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/tv/thriller-itvx-cast-plot/813139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Passenger</a></i>, strikes that balance perfectly. The tense pacing of the series coupled with witty one-liners brings a freshness to the genre thatâ€™ll keep you gripped from the first episode. Thatâ€™s not to mention how great it is to hear northern accents on TV as a Yorkshire girl myself.</p>
<p>Set in a fictional town called Chadder Vale, the six-part series explores a small town community that shares a real distrust of outsiders. Five years before the drama begins, former Met police detective Riya Ajunwa arrives in town and has been waiting for a proper crime to investigate ever since. There are only so many stolen bins her police officers can look intoâ€¦Â </p>
<p>But one night, local girl Katie Wells disappears. However, the weirdest part of Katieâ€™s disappearance is that the next day she reappears, seemingly totally fine. The townâ€™s residents remain unbothered, but Riya thinks thereâ€™s something off about the whole thing. She might be right. And as more crimes begin to unfold, the viewer is left wondering: why is the show called <i>Passenger</i>? </p>
<p>Leading the charge in <i>Passenger</i> as DIÂ Riya Ajunwa is Bafta-winning actor Wunmi Mosaku, best known for her roles in <i>Loki</i>, <i>His House</i> and <i>Lovecraft Country</i>. â€œIâ€™m nervous! It feels surreal that itâ€™s finally happening and will be out in the world soon,â€ Mosaku tells <i>Stylist </i>over Zoom. The actor came across the project in a slightly unconventional way, having heard about it from Andrew Buchan (the writer of the series) after theyâ€™d reconnected at a fundraiser a few years ago.</p>
<p>â€œWe were just catching up on what we were doing and I had mentioned how much I love boxing and he told me that what he was writing might be for me. He sent me the script, and from that moment on, he started working on drafts with me in mind,â€ says Mosaku. She was drawn to the script from the very beginning and credited Buchanâ€™s writing with how gripped she was. Mosaku is dyslexic so reading is often â€œa choreâ€ for her. â€œItâ€™s rare that I find a script that I can get through relatively quickly.â€</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="passenger Wunmi Mosaku" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2023/08/15131452/passenger_fl_01-crop-1692101818-1280x1280.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">ITVX</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A major element of <i>Passenger </i>is fear and what that emotion can make people do. â€œFor Riya, Chadder feels like a safe space in a way but thereâ€™s also a lot of frustration. Itâ€™s fear that keeps her there and itâ€™s fear that affects and shapes the local community. What do we do when we have to face those feelings? And to what lengths do we go to avoid facing those fears?â€ asks Mosaku. </p>
<p>Even though the actor has been involved in several thriller-esque projects, sheâ€™s not typically a fan of the genre as a viewer. â€œItâ€™s not something I tend to watch as I donâ€™t like the feeling of being scared; I find myself drawn to light-hearted comedies,â€ she says. Mosaku is mostly drawn to good writing that â€œholds my attentionâ€ and thatâ€™s been clever dramas and thrillers of late. Interestingly, she enjoys reading thrillers but watching them? Not so much.</p>
<p>Rooted in the north of England, the <i>Loki </i>actor felt at home on set as she grew up just down the road in Manchester. â€œThe warmth and welcoming energy of the north was definitely present on set.â€ However, as itâ€™s Mosakuâ€™s first time leading a show, she wanted to make sure the energy on set was light and joyful â€“ especially when filming a thriller. The actor explains that sheâ€™s been on sets where the showâ€™s lead has been grumpy or tense and she wanted to do things differently.</p>
<p>So, who did she take inspiration from? â€œTom Hiddleston was such a joyful leader and you could ask him anything â€“ he honestly knew the Loki scripts inside out â€“ and I wanted my set to feel like that too.â€</p>
<p>FromÂ <i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/tv/vigil-season-2-suranne-jones-cast-plot/785158" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vigil</a>Â </i>toÂ <i><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/tv/happy-valley-season-3-finale-recap/759397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Happy Valley</a> </i>and nowÂ <i>Passenger</i>, weâ€™ve seen several thrillers and crime dramas being led by women in recent years. But this series is one of the first British thrillers to be led by a Black woman, which is something that Mosaku hasnâ€™t really seen before. Representation is important for the actor as it allows everyone to feel seen and valued, and we all deserve to see reflections of ourselves on screen.Â </p>
<p>â€œIt feels great to have a Black full-figured woman lead on a TV show like this because whoever you are, whatever your background, you are the lead in your experiences.â€</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Nine Perfect Strangers </i>was a huge hit when it aired back in 2021. A psychological thriller, starring Nicole Kidman, Melissa McCarthy, Manny Jacinto and Luke Evans, it follows the story of nine strangers who are pitched together at a remote health resort led by an enigmatic, cult-like figure. Each has their own reasons for checking in, from grief-stricken parents to a struggling novelist and a Lottery-winning couple whose marriage is on the edge.Â And now the TV show is back for season two, still revolving around the same wellness resort and Kidmanâ€™s intense character Masha.</p>
<p>Based on Liane Moriartyâ€™s novel by the same name, the TV adaption was created by David E Kelley, who also bought the Moriarty adaption <i>Big Little Lies</i> to HBO.Â </p>
<h2>Who is in the cast of <i>Nine Perfect Strangers</i> season 2?</h2>
<p>Nicole Kidman returns as Masha, but this time featuring a new cast of strangers, including Henry Golding (Peter), Mark Strong (David) and Lena Olin (Helena).Â </p>
<p>They join a cast including Christine Baranski (<i>The Good Fight, The Good Wife, Mamma Mia!</i>)Â <i>The White Lotus</i>â€™s Murray Bartlett, <i>Schittâ€™s Creek</i> star Annie Murphy and other recurring cast members including Dolly De Leon, Maisie Richardson-Sellers, King Princess, Aras Aydin and Lucas Englander.</p>
<h2>What is <i>Nine Perfect Strangers </i>about?</h2>
<p>The first season focused on nine strangers who are thrown into one anotherâ€™s lives as they arrive together for an intensive programme at a much-hyped <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/wellness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wellness</a> retreat tucked away in the Australian outback. Each has their own reasons for checking in, from grief-stricken parents to a struggling novelist and a Lottery-winning couple whose marriage is on the edge.Â </p></p>
<p>The resort is run by Masha, a glamorous yet elusive figure who is on a mission to reinvigorate her guests â€“ and possibly mess with their minds. The writer, Frances, is grappling with a broken heart, but she soon becomes transfixed by the retreatâ€™s charismatic host.</p>
<p>Is Masha really as devoted to wellbeing as she seems? Or is there something more sinister lurking beneath the surface of her clean-living facade?Â </p>

<h2>Who was in season one ofÂ <i>Nine Perfect Strangers</i>?</h2>
<p>An all-star cast featured in season one alongside Nicole Kidman, withÂ <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/melissa-mccarthy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melissa McCarthy</a>Â playing one of the protagonists, lost-soul novelist Frances, as well as serving as an executive producer for the show. This marked the actorâ€™sÂ first leading TV role since her 2016 Emmy-winning performance in <i>Mike & Molly</i>.</p>
<p>Michael Shannon, Asher Keddie and Grace Van Patten starred as the Marconi family, grieving the death of their son and brother, while Luke Evans took on the role of Lars Lee, an undercover journalist there with a hidden agenda.</p>
<p>Melvin Gregg and Samara Weaving portrayed a young couple who had won the lottery, Regina Hall took on the role of a single mother of four children whose husband left her for a younger woman, and Bobby Cannavale plays Tony Hogburn, an ex-American football player struggling with a drug addiction.</p>
<h2>Is there a trailer for <i>Nine Perfect Strangers </i>season 2?</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);">Not yet, but what we do know is that the guests will stay at a Swiss Alps resort this time rather than the Australian outback.</span></p>
<h2>When will <i>Nine Perfect Strangers</i>Â season 2 air?</h2>
<p>Thereâ€™s no definitive word on when the new season will air, but watch this space.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Content note: this article contains descriptions of miscarriage and baby loss that readers may find upsetting.</b></p>
<p>â€œIâ€™m so sorry,â€ she said. </p>
<p>Somewhere inside, I already knew the worst had happened. Call it womenâ€™s intuition, but the day before our early 10-week scan I had told my husband that Iâ€™d be more surprised to hear a heartbeat than not. He looked at me as if I was going mad. After all, everything seemed to be ticking along nicely. But â€˜knowingâ€™ didnâ€™t lessen the pain of learning I had lost my baby. </p>
<p>Itâ€™s funny: we always knew weâ€™d have two kids, but weâ€™d never discussed having more than that. It became clear to me when my youngest was about 18 months old that I wasnâ€™t done. I felt a strange ache I couldnâ€™t shake. </p>
<p>I pushed hard to get my husband on board. Eventually, after heâ€™d reviewed the finances with multiple fine-toothed combs, he said yes, and we agreed to start trying in September 2023. It was all mapped out: we wanted a three-year school gap, I was hellbent on being 34 and we had a trip to Australia planned in February that I didnâ€™t want to be in the first trimester for. We even discussed how weâ€™d amend our childcare situation, how weâ€™d secure a nursery place shortly after conception and brainstormed how weâ€™d spend my husbandâ€™s new 10-week paternity leave allowance, which would land over the summer monthsÂ â€“ perhaps a month away in Lisbon?Â </p>

<h4>Iâ€™ve never seen my face so swollen, crumpled and red</h4>

</section>
<p>After becoming pregnant on the first attempt with our two daughters, sailing through both pregnancies and experiencing uncomplicated births, we were quietly expecting things to fall into place for us again. But as we started trying, I had a strange sense that something was different this time around. In the run-up to September, I had the unpleasant sensation of treading water as I waited for my â€˜fertile windowâ€™, and when it came to the dreaded two-week wait before you get a reliable test result, I found myself manically peeing on plastic sticks even though I knew it was way too early. I did one in the grubby loos of a train back from London after work, and one in a department store toilet in Tunbridge Wells, where I live, on the walk home from the station. Despite knowing it was too early, I would still feel depleted when the second line didnâ€™t show. It was exhausting and felt compulsive. Finally, at home with my husband at 6.15am, we saw the second line faintly appear on the test. Weâ€™d managed it after only one attempt for the third time, and I was both relieved and thrilled and hoped my nerves would finally dissipate.</p>
<p>And they did for a bit. The first few weeks were great, but the feeling didnâ€™t last. Around week five, my anxiety bubbled up. At six weeks, nausea and food aversions kicked in. But I couldnâ€™t shake the niggling thought that something wasnâ€™t right. At nine weeks, I went to the toilet and saw a smear of blood on the tissue â€“ not much, not even enough to have left a stain, but I was sufficiently worried that I went to the GP, dragging my daughters with me. </p>
<p>That was on a Friday. The doctors said they couldnâ€™t tell me anything without a scan, and booked me in for one on Wednesday before sending me off with a pamphlet about miscarriage, printed on greying NHS paper.Â </p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="sex-miscarriage-pregnancy-loss" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/12/10092721/gettyimages-1182045255-1080x1080.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the days between, I tried to ignore that pamphlet. I told myself everything would be fine. Finally, the day of the scan arrived and I headed to the hospital alone â€“ my husband had to be in Margate for an interview, and I assumed it would be fine for him to miss such an early scan. On arrival, I filled in a form, oscillating between hope, confidence and preparation for the worst. I imagined the call I would make to my husband to tell him everything was fineâ€¦ and the one Iâ€™d have to make if it wasnâ€™t.</p>
<p>I lay down on the bed, braced for the cold of the ultrasound gel and waited to hear a heartbeat. Nothing. The sonographer noted the measurements of the foetus at seven weeks, so perhaps it was too small for the heartbeat to be heard using this method. But at that moment, I knew. We did an internal ultrasound regardless, only to hear more deafening silence. Finally, the sonographer said it: â€œIâ€™m so sorry. Thereâ€™s no heartbeat.â€</p>
<p>I was told it was protocol to get a second opinion, so a second nurse repeated the test. To hear that silence, followed by the confirmation that there was no heartbeat, not once but twice was agony. I lay there sobbing. Iâ€™d had whatâ€™s called a missed or silent miscarriage, where the foetus dies or stops developing but there are no physical symptoms. According to <a href="https://www.whattoexpect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What To Expect</a>, a pregnancy advice website, one study estimates that fewer than 3% of pregnancies end in a missed or silent miscarriage. The odds were so low, yet there I was. </p>
<p>When I called my husband, I didnâ€™t know how to say it, so I went with: â€œI was right.â€ AndÂ when he didnâ€™t quite understand what I meant I followed it up with: â€œThereâ€™s no heartbeat.â€Â </p>
<p>I have never experienced crying like I did then. I sobbed in the toilet as I put my clothes back on, then in a quiet room where I sat on my own for an hour and waited for my husband to pick me up. Iâ€™ve never seen my face so swollen, crumpled and red. I didnâ€™t look like myself anymore. </p>
<p>During that hour, I got in touch with my friends. I told my best friend that I didnâ€™t want the doctors to take my baby out of me, the obvious next step. I told her that I felt I had failed. She did all the right things: she didnâ€™t try to make it better, and just said how awful it was, how unbelievable, and that she was as broken by it as I was â€“ the exact validation I needed. Another friend immediately went into â€˜mumâ€™ mode and told me she would pick up my eldest daughter from school and bought us sandwiches and snacks so weâ€™d have something to eat when we arrived home. It hit me in that moment that my friends are truly heroes. </p>
<p>Just over an hour later my husband arrived, red-eyed. There we were, together in the god-awful quiet room with lavender and butterflies crawling up the walls and an inexplicable lava lamp in the corner. Waiting. Crying. Talking. Itâ€™s one of the few times in as long as I can remember that we have had the chance to really talk to each other; life is hectic all the time and at the end of the day we just want to turn into TV zombies and forget the stresses. I told him that maybe we were meant to be a family of four. I had said previously that if this pregnancy didnâ€™t work out, we wouldnâ€™t try again â€“ something said flippantly by someone with the quiet confidence that all would be fine. He surprised me by saying that this had made him realise he wanted to be a family of five.  Sometimes it takes a huge loss to help you realise what it is you truly want. </p>
<p>A doctor came in to explain our three options: to wait for my body to expel the tissue naturally, to use a pessary to soften the cervix and induce contractions (I was horrified to hear that sometimes not all the tissue passes and surgery is needed, and other times it doesnâ€™t work at all) or to undergo surgery under general anaesthetic.Â </p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Freya Bugeja</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I opted for surgical management, known as a dilation and curettage procedure (D&C for short). We were having our kitchen done and downstairs floors put in. We were living in chaos, with workmen coming in and out. No kitchen sink meant we were washing up outside in a basin and you had to crawl over boxes to get to the sofa or a pan. It was a lot on its own with two small children, but going through a physical miscarriage at home, with the pain and the blood, was unfathomable. We were booked in for the following Monday, the earliest they could do, and after almost five hours in hospital, we finally went home. I am so grateful to that friend who bought the sandwiches and snacks. </p>
<p>The next few days were a mess of more crying and absolute exhaustion. My body had been trying to tell me for months how rundown I was, but I hadnâ€™t listened, ignoring the eczema on my face, the small fissures that refused to heal, the overwhelming anxiety. Now, it all seemed to be piling on top of me at once. I found myself crying at random intervals of the day because everything felt pointless. I kept carrying the mental load of maintaining the house, despite the monotony of daily life seeming futile. </p>
<p>On a particularly difficult day, the day I had my pre-surgery swabs, I raged at my husband and jumped out of our slow-moving car to get away from him, spitting some of the cruellest things that have ever come out of my mouth. At the time I very much meant it, but of course my hormones were raging, and I just didnâ€™t know how to cope. </p>
<p>The surgery went well. I had been terrified that it would start naturally beforehand but it didnâ€™t. I cried right before I was taken down for the operation, struck by the realisation that when I woke up I would no longer be pregnant. </p>
<p>Two weeks later, I had to take a pregnancy test to make sure my body had responded. All those times I had stared at tests searching for that second pink link â€“ it felt like a cruel twist to now be hoping for the opposite.Â </p>

<div class="pp-boxout__body">
<h4>My body had been trying to tell me how rundown I was</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>Itâ€™s now months later and I have used this immense low as the urge I needed to make some radical changes to my life. I took the entirety of December off work to recalibrate, quitting my job and going freelance to have more control over my hours. Iâ€™m prioritising myself more, ensuring I have non-negotiable time alone carved into my week. My husband and I are communicating better. Iâ€™m letting go of my passive aggression and being more direct with what I need.Â </p>
<p>The biggest change for me, though, is accepting and asking for help more readily. Iâ€™ve found this hard to do in the past as I have felt like a failure if I canâ€™t do it all. But my experience of miscarriage has taught me I <i>canâ€™t</i> do it all, and people really do want to help. These tiny, incremental changes have helped in mammoth ways. My anxiety has been tempered, my eczema has cleared, my shoulders have descended back to where they should be, Iâ€™m less angry and Iâ€™m only crying at appropriate moments.Â </p>
<p>Aside from these smaller lifestyle changes, I have also started therapy and Iâ€™m even working with a life coach, something I never thought Iâ€™d do. Iâ€™ve learned that I canâ€™t look after anyone properly if Iâ€™m not looking after myself. You really do need to put your oxygen mask on first before helping others. </p>
<p>Out of that dark pit of despair, I am hopeful that one day in the not-too-distant future I will look back and be able to say that if the miscarriage hadnâ€™t happened, I wouldnâ€™t be where I am today, and I will smile in thanks to that baby who never was.Â </p>
<p>Despite most people knowing that <a href="https://www.tommys.org/baby-loss-support/miscarriage-information-and-support/miscarriage-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one in five pregnancies end in miscarriage</a>, for some reason it is still a taboo subject. And once the dust has settled, there rarely feels like an appropriate time to bring it up. How do you drop the topic of baby loss into a conversation? Despite this, over the past few months, Iâ€™ve mentioned my miscarriage and, in turn, Iâ€™ve heard the stories of others. It doesnâ€™t make it hurt any less, but it has felt cathartic and has removed some misplaced shame I have felt. I want women â€“ and men â€“ to be able to talk about their experiences more openly, so if one day someone finds themselves going through it, they donâ€™t feel alone.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If youâ€™re in the mood for a series filled to the brim with impossibly attractive people in surprisingly well-fitting scrubs, youâ€™re in luck! The much-anticipated return of <i>Greyâ€™s Anatomy</i> is finally upon us, with its 20th season (yes, really) poised to drop on Disney+ this month.</p>
<p>This season of <i>Greyâ€™s </i>will be markedly different to all those that have come before it, as itâ€™s the very first not to feature Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) as a series regular.</p>
<p>While her character said goodbye in season 19, longtime fans of the show neednâ€™t fear: much as Vanessa Redgraveâ€™s Jennifer Worth still narrates <i>Call The Midwife</i> (despite the fact her on-screen counterpart left the show <i>many </i>seasons ago), Pompeo will still be voicing the intros and outros to each episode. And she will appear in four episodes of season 20, too â€“ hopefully in a less dark and twisty way than weâ€™ve become used to over the years. Hell, if anyone can use a little happiness, itâ€™s Meredith â€˜Bad Luck Follows Me Wherever I Goâ€™ Grey.</p>
<p><b>Watch the trailer for <i>Greyâ€™s Anatomy </i>season 20 below:</b></p>
<p class="stylist-youtube"><div class="iframely-youtube iframely-player iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="Grey&#039;s Anatomy S20 | Trailer | Disney+" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/4OnzeN2?maxheight=1200" data-img allowfullscreen scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture *; web-share *;"></iframe></div></div></p><p>Intrigued? Hereâ€™s what you need to know about the upcoming episodes.</p>
<h3>What is<i> Greyâ€™s Anatomy</i> season 20 about?</h3>
<p>As ever and always, the series will follow â€œthe team of doctors at Grey Sloan Memorial who are faced with life-or-death decisions on a daily basisâ€, as per the official synopsis. </p>
<p>â€œThey seek comfort from one another, and, at times, more than just friendship. Together they discover that neither medicine nor relationships can be defined in black and white.â€</p>
<p>So, expect a lot of medical jargon, high-octane drama and sexual tension. Not necessarily in that order.</p>
<h3>Who will star in<i> Greyâ€™s Anatomy</i> season 20?</h3>
<p>Pompeo may be stepping out of the limelight, but that doesnâ€™t mean there wonâ€™t be more than enough doctors and interns to root for this time around.</p>
<p>Chandra Wilson, for starters, is back as our beloved Dr Miranda Bailey, while James Pickens Jr will be reprising his role as Dr Richard Webber.</p>
<p>We have a ragtag group of interns in the form of Lucas (Niko Terho), as well as Blue (Harry Shum Jr), Jules (Adelaide Kane), Mika (Midori Francis) and Simone (Alexis Floyd) â€“ all of whom face an uncertain future after the events of last season. </p>
<p>We will also see the return of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kevin McKidd as Owen Hunt</li>
<li>Kim Raver as Teddy Altman </li>
<li>Caterina Scorsone as Amelia Shepherd</li>
<li>Camilla Luddington as Jo Wilson</li>
<li>Scott Speedman as Nick Marsh</li>
<li>Chris Carmack as Atticus â€˜Linkâ€™ Lincoln </li>
<li>Anthony Hill as Winston Ndugu</li>
<li>Jake Borelli as Levi Schmitt </li>
<li>Jessica Capshaw as Dr Arizona Robbins</li>
<li>Alex Landi as Dr Nico Kim</li>
</ul>
<p>Natalie Morales and Freddy Miyares will also be joining the cast as a paediatric surgeon and a likeable patient, respectively.</p>
<h3>What are people saying about <i>Greyâ€™s Anatomy </i>season 20?</h3>
<p>Succeeding Krista Vernoff as the series showrunner, Meg Marinis has promised that this season will take things â€œback to basicsâ€ with a surprising reset twist.</p>
<p>More importantly, she told <i><a href="https://deadline.com/2024/03/greys-anatomy-season-20-premiere-recap-postmortem-showrunner-meg-marinis-qa-bailey-meredith-amelia-1235859328/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> </i>that fans neednâ€™t worry about Meredith Grey being written out of the show permanently.</p>
<p>â€œHer status is that sheâ€™s always a huge part of the show. I donâ€™t know the answer to your question about why they choose to list it that way. But we have an open-door policy with her. When she is able to be here, we welcome her with open arms. We work with her schedule, she still does the voice-over. She was a huge part of the premiere for me, she and I have a great relationship. Sheâ€™s constantly in my head, her voice. She cares very deeply for the show and even in the episodes that sheâ€™s not in, sheâ€™s interested to know whatâ€™s happening. So, youâ€™ll see her come and go and she will always remain a very important part to the show.â€</p>
<h3>When can we watch <i>Greyâ€™s Anatomy </i>season 20?</h3>
<p>The season 20 premiere of <i>Greyâ€™s Anatomy </i>will drop via Disney+ on Thursday 28 March, with episodes dropping weekly on Thursdays thereafter.</p>
<p>Will you be tuning in?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If youâ€™ve grown gloomy with the general state of the world (and who can blame you?), then the TV gods are here to remind you that love, actually, is all around. Enter the fray, please, <i>Big Gay Wedding With Tom Allen</i>.</p>
<p>The BBC One special has been commissioned to mark a truly momentous occasion: the 10th anniversary of the first same-sex wedding in the UK. </p>
<p>This means that the 60-minute film will not only see the aforementioned Allen pull out all the stops to arrange a dream wedding for one gay couple it will also explore how LGBTQ+ campaigners won the fight to have equal marriage legalised in the UK in 2003. Along the way, Allen will speak with activists, including Lynn Sutcliffe and Sarah Hews, who made headlines in 1992 for presenting themselves at Westminster Registry Office to be married â€“ as well as Angela Eagle, the MP who helped introduce civil partnerships in 2004.</p>
<p>â€œWhen I was growing up, the idea that gay people could be accepted by society, never mind get married, was as mad as a sack of chihuahuas,â€ says Allen matter-of-factly. </p>
<p>â€œNow, every year, thousands of same-sex couples get married, and thatâ€™s certainly something to celebrate. Now two people can say they love each other in front of their friends and families and have it recognised by all of us in society, and thatâ€™s a wonderful thing.â€</p>

</figure>
<p>Allen â€“ who will work alongside the likes of Oti Mabuse and Sophie Ellis-Bextor to plan a wedding in just three months â€“ continues: â€œIn the eyes of the law means more than just â€˜a weddingâ€™. Itâ€™s a much more profound symbol â€“ a statement that we, as gay people, are actually equal to others, worthy of relationships and deserving of the same rights as everyone else. In partaking in marriage we are part of the rest of the world and the history of humankind.â€</p>
<p>â€œMaybe that seems like a grand statement but for so much of history, queer people have been made to feel less than everyone else or outside of society,â€ he finishes.Â </p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">BBC/Minnow Films</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the one-off film for BBC One and iPlayer, Allen will reflect on his own experiences of growing up gay as he considers how far LGBTQ+ rights have advanced. </p>
<p>Best of all? Well, the whole thing will culminate in the wedding of the happy couple, in what the BBC has promised will be a â€œjoyous celebration of love, community and hard-won equalityâ€. </p>
<p>Consider us sold!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While most of us canâ€™t really go around changing our <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/haircuts-hairstyles-hair-colour-trends-2024/852795" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hair colour</a> every single season, thereâ€™s something very special about spring when it comes to making us want to try something new.</p>
<p>Maybe itâ€™s the longer days or how tantalisingly close we are to warm weather at this time of year. Maybe itâ€™s something to do with the fact that spring is so closely associated with renewal and rebirth. Whatever it is, it can be a good time for a change.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re in the mood to spring clean your look, so to speak, these are the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/spring-hair-colour-trends-brunette-crunette-melted-chocolate/769440" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">colour trends</a> that expert stylists believe are going to be big for the new season.</p>
<h2>Refined naturals</h2>
<p>Jason Crozier, art director at <a href="https://nevillehairandbeauty.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neville Hair & Beauty</a>, tells <i>Stylist</i>: â€œThe trend towards natural-looking hair colours continues to dominate, but with a refined twist. Think rich brunettes, warm blondes and radiant coppers that are deep, glossy and meticulously tailored to enhance the natural complexion of the wearer. These hues are not just about looking natural; theyâ€™re about perfecting and elevating oneâ€™s inherent beauty with subtle nuances in shade.â€</p>
<div class="iframely-instagram iframely-app iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="Kennedy Walsh on Instagram: &quot;sheâ€™s still 23â€¦. inside her fantasyâ€¦. ðŸ§šðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸âœ¨ðŸª©ðŸŒ·ðŸ±ðŸª·&quot;" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/zoVKnt5?maxheight=1200&app=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2>Luxurious metallics</h2>
</p>
<p>Crozier says: â€œMetallic shades are making a luxurious comeback, with rose gold, silver blonde and metallic lilac leading the charge. These colours offer a sophisticated, fashion-forward edge. The key to these metallics is a seamless blend, creating a luminous finish that catches the light beautifully.â€Â </p>

</p>
<p>â€œIn contrast to the more subtle trends,â€ says Crozier, â€œbold statement streaks in vibrant colours like electric blue, neon pink and Gen Z yellow are emerging as a form of personal expression for the bold at heart. These are not all-over colours but rather strategic accents that add a unique pop to the hair â€“ perfect for clients looking to make a statement without committing to a full head of vivid colour.â€</p>

</p>
<p>â€œPastels have evolved into more dimensional, layered hues,â€ says Crozier. â€œPastel balayage and under-lights offer a fresh take on soft colours. These arenâ€™t the pastels of yesteryear; theyâ€™re sophisticated, with depth and movement, designed to look incredible in both natural and artificial light. Think soft lavender, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/pink-hair-trend/747474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peachy pinks</a>Â and pale mint greens applied with a technique that ensures they grow out beautifully.â€</p>

<p>Hair stylist and colouristÂ <a href="https://www.instagram.com/carleybaynehair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carley Bayne</a>Â tells us: â€œAt the end of summer 2023, I noticed a big change in clients and their need for cool ashy blondes â€“ the ones that reach for the purple shampoo at every given chance. This was the start of the buttery blonde and itâ€™s going to be huge this year. â€˜Butteryâ€™, â€˜creamyâ€™ and â€˜goldenâ€™ are the words you want to use to describe these bright, more flattering tones. Lighter skin tones will suit the buttery tones best whereas darker skin and more lived-in blondes work best with the creamer golden tones.â€</p>

<p>Bayne says: â€œThis trend is perfect for clients wanting a more natural result and works great on all skin tones. Soft caramel tones on a lighter base will add movement and shine to the hair. On darker hair colours, think dark chocolate with bright caramel highlights throughout, which makes for a great contrast. This colour works beautifully on curly hair too. Just make sure you ask your stylist for a root shadow to ensure a perfect blend from root to tip.â€</p>

<p><a href="https://larrykinghair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Larry King Hair</a>â€™s Amy Fish says: â€œWe are really loving the cowgirl scene we are seeing in fashion at the moment and feel it is going to get bigger over the spring. We have created our own hair trends to complement this new vibe, the first of which is â€˜ranch ribbonsâ€™. We love taking hair that little bit lighter in springtime. It gives us all a little bit of lift. This trend involves soft ribbons of colours painted from the ear downwards. Think wearing a cowboy hat and the way sunshine hits the hair from the hat downwards.â€</p>

<h2>Western bay</h2>
<p>Fish says: â€œA new take on cowboy copper. Itâ€™s more of a subtle brown red shade that can suit most skin tones. This is great for clients that have a darker skin tone and tighter curls.â€</p>

<h2>Pammy blonde</h2>
<p>â€œOur take on the new It blonde,â€ says Fish. â€œThink Pamela Anderson in the early 2000s. Not a bleach white blonde, but a softer sunset blonde that can be created with no bleach to keep the hair in that perfect condition.â€</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Always tired? It could be down to having one of these 5 personality types]]></title>
			<description>Do you struggle to find the energy to get through the day? If you fall into one of these personality types, that might be why, says Karina Antram.</description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Constantly exhausted? You <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/sleep/why-tired-all-the-time/766502" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shouldnâ€™t be putting up with it</a>. Low energy levels can be caused by a wide range of factors, such as illness (which is why, if youâ€™re constantly tired, itâ€™s vital you talk to a medical professional), stress, diet, and poor-quality sleep. But one cause you probably havenâ€™t considered? Your personality type.</p>
<p>In her book, <i>Fix Your Fatigue</i>, coach and nutritionist Karina Antram notes that certain personality types are prone to feeling more tired, pointing to research (Greenberg, 2002) that found that people with any of these four key characteristics are more prone to fatigue and burnout: hard-working, perfectionist, obsessive-compulsive and overactive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>â€œType A personality types, such as those who are competitive, highly motivated, organised and ambitious, according to science have a greater risk of fatigue and burnout than Type Bs who are more relaxed, content and less ambitious,â€ Antram tells <i>Stylist</i>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She goes on to describe five personality types that are also likely to be more tired, more often. Do any of them resonate?</p>
<h2>The supporter</h2><p>Are you someone who gives, gives, gives, only to find youâ€™ve got no time or energy left to take care of yourself? Thatâ€™s being â€˜the supporterâ€™, and, as youâ€™d expect, results in tiredness.Â </p>
<h2>The mood depleter</h2><p>â€œYou focus on past events, ruminating on what you could have done differently or failed at,â€ Antram explains. â€œAs a result, you struggle to root yourself in the present day.â€</p>
<p>When your brain is so busy thinking about the past and beating itself up, itâ€™s no surprise that youâ€™re exhausted by lunchtime.Â </p>
<h2>The futuristic</h2><p>If the mood depleter is all about the past, the futuristic isÂ â€“ you guessed itÂ â€“ the same pattern, but about the future. You worry so much about what will happen next that you canâ€™t be in the present moment.Â <b>Â </b></p>
<h2>The overthinker</h2><p>Of this type, Antram says: â€œYou are always in fight or flight mode, which uses up a lot of energy. You often give thoughts far too much time and attention, creating fear or anxiety about what is to come.â€</p>
<p>Sounds tiring, right?</p>
<h2>The captive</h2><p>Empaths, prepare to be @-ed.Â </p>
<p>Of the captive personality type, Antram says: â€œIf your family or friends are going through a tough time, you have a tendency to absorb these emotions. This can eat away at energy.â€</p>
<p>Basically, youâ€™re like a sponge, soaking up other peopleâ€™s negative vibes and mishaps. When youâ€™re carrying not only your own emotions, but everyone elseâ€™s, youâ€™re bound to feel wiped out.Â </p>
<p>Feel like youâ€™re ticking off multiple types? Thatâ€™s normal.Â </p>
<p>â€œWe may naturally fall into one personality type but the likelihood is we may fall across some or all of them,â€ Antram notes. â€œIf we all just fit into one personality type we would do our wonderful personalities a disservice.</p>
<p>â€œWhat this is suggesting is to be mindful of some of the traits you have, as they may cause energy leaks.Â </p>
<p>â€œTake the futuristic. You may be someone who really struggles to be present. You are always planning the next task, meal, event, holiday or project and canâ€™t ever be content with your present reality. This may manifest in constantly moving from one thing to the next and never really appreciating what you have at any given moment.â€</p>
<p>Donâ€™t stress about this too much, though. Having these personality types does not mean you have a life sentence to the always-tired club. Antram emphasises that we can change, improve and tackle any tiredness triggers at the sourceÂ â€“ and understanding where your low energy comes from is the first step.Â </p>
<p>â€œAccording to the research, 8% of us genetically are predisposed to having low energy levels,â€ she tells us. â€œThat said, we know we do have the capability of switching our genes on and off, due to epigenetics. If your tiredness is due to a biochemical reason or perhaps because you have one of these personality types like the futuristic, then I always believe we have the capacity to change.â€</p>
<p>One way to approach this change is by using the ACE technique. This helps you to stop negative thought loops (which are a big part of the personality types above) in their tracks and come back to the present moment. Antram breaks it down ahead.Â </p>
<h2>How to use the ACE technique</h2><p>Antram says: â€œControlling how and what we think might sound impossible, but itâ€™s actually easier than you think. With a little practice, you can learn to notice unhelpful thoughts and stop them from draining your energy. This is particularly helpful if you are struggling with long-term fatigue. To do this, use the ACE acronym.â€</p>
<h3><b>A: acknowledge thoughts and feelings</b></h3>
<p>â€œTry naming the thought process (eg â€˜Thereâ€™s an anxious/worried/frustrated thoughtâ€™) and notice where you feel the emotion in your body.â€</p>
<h3><b>C: connect with your body</b></h3>
<p>â€œGround your feet into the floor, stretch your back, press your hands and fingers together. Bring your focus of attention to your physical being as encapsulating your thoughts and feelings.â€</p>
<h3><b>E: engage with the world around you</b></h3>
<p>â€œNotice four things you can see, four things you can hear and four things you can touch.â€</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you finish every <a href="http://stylist.co.uk/tag/cardio-workouts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cardio session</a> looking as red as a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/beetroot-exercise-performance/611365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beetroot</a> and sweating from every pore? While getting your <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/monitor-heart-rate-maximise-workouts/555705" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heart rate</a> up close to its max has its benefits, not every session needs to be incredibly intense. Actually, training with a lower heart rate can be good for you. </p>
<p>Thatâ€™s particularly true of â€˜zone twoâ€™ cardio. â€œZone two training is a form of aerobic exercise thatâ€™s loosely defined as 65-70% of someoneâ€™s <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/best-cardio-exercises/648890" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximum heart rate</a>,â€ explains Richard Malpass, a personal trainer and founder of â€‹â€‹<a href="https://factr.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FACTR gym</a>.Â </p>
<p>â€œGenerally speaking, this will mean exercising with a heart rate of around 120-140 beats per minute.

<p>â€œIt is particularly effective at capillarisation, the process of increasing the number of capillaries that serve a muscle and thus improve your muscular and aerobic endurance by delivering oxygen to that area of the body.â€</p>
<p>For Malpass, the benefits go beyond just the physical changes: â€œIt can be a far more <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/social-fitness-quality-time-family-friends/454280" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social activity</a> and due to the reduced intensity it can often be less daunting. The barrier to entry for this type of workout is lower, as you are able to spend time having a chat and you wonâ€™t be too fatigued.â€</p>

<p>Yes, itâ€™s good for beginners, but even pros should do zone two training, says Thiruchelvam. â€œItâ€™s often overlooked by runners and cyclists because itâ€™s â€˜not challengingâ€™, but it should be an integral component of their training,â€ he says.
	  </p>
<h2>How to do zone two cardio training&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>First, you need to pick your workout. You can use any form of cyclical cardio, like running, cycling, rowing or even a brisk walk. Avoid HIIT or weight training as this makes your heart rate go up and down, rather than stay within one zone.</p>
<p>â€œMany people struggle to actually slow down enough to stay in zone two and their heart rate often strays above the desired rate,â€ says Malpass. â€œSo when choosing a method, ensure you pick something that you are proficient at and have some element of control over the pace or intensity.â€</p>
<p>That might mean an indoor treadmill where you can pick the pace, but one of the joys of zone two is that it can be done with friends or without too much struggle. â€œThe best method is the one you enjoy most; if you prefer hiking rather than an indoor bike in the gym, then thatâ€™s absolutely fine,â€ says Malpass.</p>
<p>Thiruchelvam adds: â€œIf you are including zone two cardio as part of your training for an event, itâ€™s best to mimic the activity, like running if you are working towards a half marathon.â€ </p>
<p>Ideally, zone two will make up the bulk of your cardio, says Thiruchelvam. â€œVery often it will form around 60-70% of your entire aerobic training. Faster and more intense sessions should only contribute to about 30% of your week,â€ he explains.Â </p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Woman using fitness tracker" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2022/08/18123745/zone-two-671x671.png">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That might sound like a lot, but it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean you need to swap all of your HIIT sessions for lower-intensity movement. A brisk walk will probably get you in the heart rate zone, which most of us will already be doing daily â€“ a reminder that your daily walk has huge health benefits.</p>
<h2>How to measure zone two cardio&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>If youâ€™re serious about keeping yourself in the zone, use a tracker. You can either measure your maximum heart rate then work out what 65-70% of it is or simply aim to keep it within the general 120-140bpm range.</p>
<p>If you donâ€™t have a tracker or donâ€™t like using them, they try the â€˜talk testâ€™. â€œIf you can maintain a steady conversation whilst exercising, then youâ€™re probably in zone 2, whereas if your conversation is broken up and it feels unnatural, then you may have strayed into zone 3 or above, which is more intense,â€ says Malpass.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thereâ€™s nothing worse than spending hours at the gym slogging your guts out, only to feel as though youâ€™re not making much progress. You might be <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/progressive-overloading-home-gains/472832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">progressively overloading</a> your key moves, getting a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/the-link-between-gut-health/673019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decent sleep most nights</a> and eating well but still not see great returns on your investment.Â </p>
<p>The missing keyÂ â€“ the one that just about impacts every part of our physical and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/gut-health-affects-emotions-mood/390445" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mental health</a>Â â€“ may be gut health. If youâ€™re someone who struggles with bloating, sluggishness, non-regular loo habits, then itâ€™s time to see if your gut microbiome is actively usurping your efforts to get fitter.Â </p>
<h2>5 reasons poor gut health is making you weaker</h2><h3>Lower levels of nutrient absorptionÂ </h3>
<p>â€œThe gut plays a vital role in absorption and utilisation of essential nutrients that are needed all around the body for many different functions. This can include energy production and metabolism,â€ explains allplantsâ€™ nutritionist Ally Findlay.Â </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);">We all know that nutrition plays a big part in athletic performance and â€œwith a weakened or unhealthy gut, youâ€™re less able to fully absorb the nutrients in the food you consume, which could have a knock-on effect on your progress and health in general.â€Â </span></p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Woman eating fruit salad" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/07/14121429/gettyimages-1407935548-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Increased inflammation</h3>
<p>Of course, itâ€™s not just that poor gut health can make us weaker; doing too much intense exercise can weaken out guts. According to Michelle den Hollander, nutritionist and hormone expert, lots of intense exercise can cause the body to release hormones that promote the growth of â€œbadâ€ bacteria and other inflammation-promoting substances.Â </p>
<p>â€œIf you are training intensively, you may also experience a â€˜<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/leaky-gut-syndrome/662422" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaky gut</a>â€™ where the intestinal lining opens up, making room for bad bacteria to leave the intestinal canal and start moving around your body. This compromises the immune system significantly and needs to be treated as soon as possible.â€Â </p>
<p>The key, she says, is to listen to your body as you know your body best. â€œBy ignoring signs like a bloated belly or pain, you can make things worse. So if any of these symptoms happen regularly, reduce your exercise impact or take a day off and if it disappears and does not come back then continue.â€</p>
<h3>Risk of constipation</h3>
<p>Another factor, when it comes to exercise, is dehydration. If you donâ€™t come up with a plan for taking on fluids on a long run or commit to rehydrating once you finish your work out, you might run into further digestive issues.Â </p>
<p>Findlay explains that the large intestine soaks up the water it has access to, making your digestion slow down â€“ resulting in constipation. If you are experiencing gut related problems when exercising, Findlay says that â€œthere is likely another factor involved and it is worth checking in with your doctor.â€
	  </p>
<h3>Increased discomfort</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);">denÂ </span><span style="font-size: 18px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);">Hollander warns: â€œBloating and inflammation will definitely get in the way of training and thus hinder you from your fitness goals. Gut health is often underestimated when, in fact, itâ€™s a big factor to consider when you want to getÂ fit.â€Â </span></p>
<p>If youâ€™re used to feeling bloated during or after a run, you might be tempted to change how and when you fuel. While the timing of when you eat wonâ€™t impact your gut health itself, food can get in the way during training if you leave too little time between a meal and a workout. Choose an easily digestible snack like a banana or bread and nut butter before a workout but give yourself an hour between a meal and movement.</p>
<h3>Slower lactic acid clearanceÂ </h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);">den Hollander explains that our gut not only helps with digestion, it also plays a role in our metabolism, immune and hormonal system and even our cognitive functions â€“ all of which affect our physical performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);">Â â€œItÂ has also been proven that our gut breaks down lactic acid that is needed to build up muscles, so if your gut health is poor it wonâ€™t be able to work effectively to help your strength and muscles grow.â€</span></p>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Symptoms of poor gut health</h2><p>Our guts are always busy. If theyâ€™re not absorbing nutrients to keep us nourished, energised and strong, theyâ€™re supporting the immune system. A â€œhealthyâ€ gut has a rich array of gut microbiota (the millions of microorganisms within your digestive tract) so that it can carry out all of its functions properly. That means having lots of different kinds of bacteria; the more diverse the microbiota, the stronger the gut.</p>
<p>â€¨There are lots of factors that lead to poor gut health, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-stress levels (emotional and physical)</li>
<li>A diet high in processed and refined foods (especially foods containing lots of additives and preservatives)</li>
<li>Too much exposure to antibiotics or other drugs</li>
</ul>
<p>Given how important our guts are, itâ€™s pretty noticeable when things go wrong. Common symptoms to look out for are bloating and gas, which Findlay says â€œcan signal high levels of bad gut bacteriaâ€.Â </p>
<p>Food intolerances can also be a sign that the gut is not functioning correctly; you may not be able to break down food correctly and that causes reactions in the body. Oh, and because gut bacteria is linked to the immune systems, gut problems can negatively impact immune health too.Â Â </p>
<h2>Can exercise actually improve gut health?</h2><p><span style="font-size: 18px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);">Research shows that regular aerobic exercise can actually beneficially change your gut bacteria and microbiome.Â </span></p>
<p>A <a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/EP087404" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 study</a> published in the journal <i>Experimental PhysiologyÂ </i>concluded that those people with higher cardiorespiratory fitness tend to have a more diverse bacterial population in the gut, compared with those with a lower level of cardio fitness. </p>
<p>Another <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18256465/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study </a>found that exerciseÂ promotes the growth of bacteriaÂ which produce the fatty acid,Â butyrate. Butyrate is thought to reduce inflammation (reducing the risk of issues like inflammatory bowel disease and insulin resistance), as well as help to heal the gut lining. But you donâ€™t have to do HIIT or sprints to reap the gut benefits. The same paper found that women who do<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28187199/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> at leastÂ three hours o</a>f light exerciseÂ (such as a brisk walk) per week have been found to have increased levels of anti-inflammatory bacteriasÂ compared with more sedentary individuals.Â </p>
<section class="pp-article__boxout">
<div id="boxout_1" class="pp-boxout" style="background-color:#606060;">
<div class="pp-boxout__body">
<h4>Women who do 3 hours of light exercise a week have better gut health</h4>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p>If youâ€™re a runner or cyclist, youâ€™ve got a reason to feel good: researchers have shown runners and cyclistsÂ produce more <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/426788xv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">endocannabinoids</a>Â in their blood, which provides some pain relief andÂ <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30534062/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improves mood</a>.Â Endocannabinoids are involved in controlling gut inflammation and protecting our gut barrier. Whatâ€™s not yet been established, however, is how short-lived these changes are or whether that boost can lead to long-term changes in the gut microbiome.Â </p>
<p>Given that â€œrunnerâ€™s stomachâ€ is such a thing (ask anyone whoâ€™s trained for a long-distance event and theyâ€™ll tell you that their guts have become incredibly sensitive), however, surely thereâ€™s a limit to how much movement is <i>good</i>Â for a gut?</p>
<p>Our digestive systems may be able to handle a lot but ultimately, they arenâ€™t designed to experience the kind of incessant stress that hours of running can create. When we run or engage in lots of high-intensity activity, our blood flow moves away from the digestive system to the cardiovascular system. That then can trigger an inflammatory response in the gut.Â </p>
<h2>6 tips for a happier, stronger gut</h2><h3>1. Eat the rainbow</h3>
<div>
<p>Thereâ€™s no one hero food but a wide range of natural foods will lead to a diverse microbiota. Having a diet of whole foods such as fruits and veg is the best way of nourishing a healthy gut. They are rich in fibre and promote the growth of beneficial gut microbes.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Fill up on fibre</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>There are two different types of fibre. Most whole foods have both soluble and insoluble fibres. Insoluble fibre â€“ the roughage like stalks, seeds, skins of foods â€“ helps to move things along and keep us regular, which is key for good gut health. Water-soluble fibre binds with water and creates a gel that can feed healthy gut bacteria. It can also help to reduce cholesterol.</p>
<h3>3. Prioritise food- based probiotics</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Prebiotics are fibrous foods that when digested, ferment in the gut and feed the healthy bacteria, promoting the growth of more healthy gut microbes. Prebiotic rich foods are very simple foods such as onions, garlic, bananas, oats, legumes and whole grains.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Enjoy a side of probiotic</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Fermented foods including kimchi, sauerkraut and kombucha are rich in live bacterial cultures which feed the healthy bacteria in the gut.&nbsp;People can often be sensitive to these types of food, so if you are increasing the amount of them in your diet, make sure to do so slowly so the body has time to get used to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Calm it down</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Too much stress or anxiety (which can also be caused from exercising too intensely!) can cause your digestive system to go into overdrive and your body to go into fight or flight mode. This means that your gut health will decrease, your digestion will be affected and you may suffer from constipation. Try out slow and grounding activities&nbsp;like yin yoga, meditation, reading or walking.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. See your GP</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>If gut issues persist, it is worth trying to find out if you have any food intolerances that could be causing these reactions.</p>
<h3>6. Hydrate</h3>
</div>
<p>Water is a key component of digestion and ensures the proper absorption of nutrients. Water also keeps food moving through the intestines. If you donâ€™t have enough water in your body, water is reabsorbed from the colon often leading to hard stools and constipation.&nbsp;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Easter just around the corner, chocolate is on all of our minds. Do we buy our own egg or email a suggestion to our nearest and dearest? Is there any point in buying a specific egg to eat on Easter Sunday when weâ€™ve been having daily 3pm Mini Egg break since February? Chocolate is one of those tricky nutritional areas; we know that for the most part, itâ€™s best enjoyed in moderation and yet some types of chocolate are absolutely brimming with nutrients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know, for example, that dark chocolate with a high cacao percentage is chockfull of magnesium (which is what you <i>actually</i>&nbsp;crave when you suddenly get a pang for Dairy Milk the day before your period). And the dark stuff also tends to contain loads of fiber, antioxidants and gut-loving polyphenols. In fact, Zoeâ€™s Dr Tim Spector has said that dark chocolate has several times more antioxidants than green tea or red wine. </p>
<p>With that in mind, weâ€™ve gathered together three simple chocolate recipes that use added beneficial ingredients like omega 3-rich hemp seeds and a&nbsp;bunch of other natural goodies.&nbsp;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>â€œLiving with resentment might make things complicatedâ€Â </h2>
<p><b style="font-size: 18px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);">Charlotte Fox Weber is a psychotherapist who works with couples and the author of <i>What We Want.</i></b></p>
<p>â€œI feel for you. This issue comes up all the time in therapy, and when one person <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/scared-of-having-a-baby-motherhood/857409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doesnâ€™t want to have children</a>, itâ€™s usually not a hard no, but a kind of â€˜Iâ€™m not readyâ€™, which can be maddeningly vague. For heterosexual couples it can feel particularly unfair because there are biological limitations for women that just donâ€™t exist as much for men â€“ and certainly donâ€™t exist as much in terms of <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/fertility-worries-motherhood-ambivalence/846311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">societal timelines</a>. At the moment, because there are uncertainties about whether his decision is final, no one wants to close the door. And the plot could dawdle unless you move forward and deal with the difficult loss either way. Thereâ€™s no getting away from the grief. The idea that youâ€™ll get away without loss if you just navigate the situation is sadly not true.</p>
<p>â€œIâ€™ve worked with people whoâ€™ve survived and dealt with the loss of not having children because one person doesnâ€™t want to. The grief that comes with this choice in a relationship can be complicated when thereâ€™s resentment. This is going to be hard, but facing the fact that the man youâ€™re in a relationship with cannot offer you a major thing youâ€™re looking for is important. Iâ€™d challenge you on why you want to give your future to someone who is uncompromising. If you really want children and he doesnâ€™t, itâ€™s worth asking yourself why you want to have children with <i>him</i>. You might struggle to make peace with the compromise whatever happens, but donâ€™t pressure yourself to be entirely resolved and sorted out either way. You can make a choice about the relationship for now without feeling like you<b>Â </b>must then have your revised life plan sorted out.â€</p>
<h2>â€œTalking is the only solution: talk about your childhood, your family and what you might lose out onâ€</h2>
<p><b>Susanna Abse, psychotherapist specialising in relationships and author of <i>Tell Me The Truth About Love.</i></b></p>
<p>â€œThis situation isnâ€™t uncommon, and it can feel like itâ€™s irresolvable. Unlike deciding where to live, thereâ€™s no middle ground when it comes to having children. Talking is really the only solution to this. Keep talking. Talk about why you want children. Talk about your own experience of children in your life, what it was like to be a child, what you felt about family, whether you thought your parents liked having children, what you feel youâ€™ll lose if you donâ€™t have children. Conversations with your partner around having children should have a quality of open exploration where you can be curious about each otherâ€™s point of view (if it feels a bit â€˜my way or the highwayâ€™ then you might need someone else â€“ like a therapist â€“ to help you).</p>
<p>â€œYour situation goes to show how important it is that couples talk about things like having children early on. Lots of relationships are what we call â€˜slide, donâ€™t decideâ€™, where you slide into a relationship, even a marriage, without ever really having a conversation about what each of you wants out of life. I notice this in a lot of couples who come to see me: suddenly, theyâ€™re 37, havenâ€™t really ever had any real conversations about what they want, and feel like theyâ€™re running out of time to come to an agreement. The good thing is that you <i>do</i> have time to find out what this means to you and your partner. And while the nature of a relationship is often bearing and tolerating differences between you, you also have to be able to feel that together you can foster a shared vision of what life will be.â€Â </p>
<h2>â€œThis is a dealbreaker; one of you will always feel like youâ€™ve lostâ€</h2>
<p><b>Michaela Thomas is a couples therapist and author of <i>The Lasting Connection.</i></b></p>
<p>â€œThe three-year mark is often when we have conversations about where weâ€™re going and how serious the relationship is, and Iâ€™m very glad youâ€™ve talked about <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/long-reads/cost-of-children-motherhood-penalty/817886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whether you want children or not</a>. Itâ€™s important to be aware that time spent together just waiting to come to a decision is not necessarily time spent enjoying your life together. When couples realise that one of them wants a child or children and the other one doesnâ€™t, itâ€™s whatâ€™s called a dealbreaker â€“ because itâ€™s often impossible to come to a compromise.</p>
<p>â€œLiving in this type of limbo can be really stressful. Youâ€™ve decided different things, and when weâ€™ve come to these types of crossroads, the incompatible life choices, the clashes of our values, the clashes of our wishes for their lives, itâ€™s rare for that to ever work out. One of you will always feel like youâ€™ve lost â€“ thereâ€™s a difference between a compromise and a sacrifice. If one of you makes a sacrifice or feels like a choice was taken away from you, you are more likely to feel resentful towards your partner, and it might create discord in the future. Try to find an unbiased, external person to talk things through with â€“ it sounds like you have a solid relationship that should be strong enough to tolerate these conversations and make a wise decision together, regardless of whether that means staying together or growing apart.â€</p>
<h2>â€œWhen you feel time is running out, the pressure makes everything harderâ€</h2>
<p><b>Andrew G Marshall is a marital therapist and host of <i>The Meaningful Life</i> podcast.</b></p>
<p>â€œThe first thing Iâ€™d say is that the minute you think time is running out, you increase the pressure on both you and your partner. And when youâ€™re making big decisions, pressure is the last thing you need. The thing we tend to do in these kinds of conversations is that when our partners share an issue â€“ for example, they donâ€™t feel ready yet â€“ our initial response is to try to persuade them otherwise. Instead, we should be asking questions. <i>Can you tell me more about that? What would be the signs that you might be ready? What things do you want to achieve in your life before you have children?</i> Trying to find out as much as possible is a good place to start. </p>
<p>â€œYou donâ€™t have to try to diagnose problems, but asking questions like this takes us to a different place, with more exploration and less pressure to make a decision. Similarly, share how your thoughts have evolved over time so he has a clear idea of where youâ€™re coming from. The likelihood is that youâ€™ll probably both be worried about saying what you truly want and believe because of what it might mean for the relationship, but itâ€™s important to express what you both want â€“ and why you feel that way â€“ so that you donâ€™t end up having the same argument 30 times over and can understand each other better.â€</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all have those days when we just canâ€™t be bothered. When your mind is preoccupied with your growing <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/mit-method/871416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to-do list</a> or your <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/sleep/energy-levels-fluctuate/654747" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">energy levels are slumping</a>, working out just isnâ€™t appealing.  </p>
<p>Sometimes, though, you have days that are the complete opposite â€“ when the idea of just going through the motions isnâ€™t enough to satisfy the urge to push yourself. On those days, you want an easy way to give yourself a little extra challenge â€“ and thatâ€™s where ankle weights come in.  </p>
<p>Ankle weights can be used in a variety of ways, but theyâ€™re especially helpful for making pre-existing activities more challenging, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/ankle-weights-while-walking/789709" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as we found out when we put them to the test on a normal walk</a>.Â </p>
<p>So, whether youâ€™re looking to speed up your progress in the gym or boost your cardiovascular fitness, hereâ€™s why picking up a pair of ankle weights is a good idea. Plus, we look at some of the techniques you can use.Â 
	  </p>
<h2>Why are ankle weights so good for building overall fitness?Â </h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="A woman doing an ab workout with ankle weights on at home" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2024/03/13165902/ankle-weight-workout-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As far as fitness equipment goes, ankle weights are small but mighty. Theyâ€™re relatively cheap, easy to use and can make a serious difference to the difficulty of many workouts â€“ especially for beginners who arenâ€™t ready to make the step up to bigger <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/free-weights-benefits-gym-at-home-workouts-dumbbell-exercises-weight-training-tips/341458" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free weights</a>. </p>
<p>â€œAnkle weights can be effective tools for building strength and improving fitness when theyâ€™re used appropriately and in conjunction with a well-rounded exercise programme,â€ explains Ali Malik, a personal trainer and founder of <a href="https://www.fitlabskensington.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fit Labs Kensington</a>. â€œThey provide progressive resistance, allowing for <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/progressive-overloading-home-gains/472832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gradual overload</a> and muscle adaptation, leading to strength gains and improved <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/what-is-strength-endurance-training/388046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">muscular endurance</a>.â€ </p>
<p>There are, of course, many ways to build muscle, so the resistance ankle weights provide isnâ€™t exactly unique. But what makes them stand out is the way they do so while also providing extra benefits.Â </p>
<p>â€œBy placing an added weight onto the outer parts of our body we are changing our centre of gravity,â€ Gemma Folkard, founder of <a href="https://shape-pilates.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shape Pilates</a>, points out. â€œThis means the ankle (or wrist) weights not only increase the work for the limb theyâ€™re attached to, but also the centre of the body â€“ <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/strong-core-benefits/801698#:~:text=%E2%80%9CA%20strong%20core%20keeps%20you,%2C%20form%20and%20injury%20prevention.%E2%80%9D&text=Pilates%20and%20yoga%20may%20be,can%20improve%20your%20practice%20too." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the core</a>.â€ </p>
<p>She continues: â€œUsing light weights also means that you can still mobilise the joints while increasing resistance for the surrounding musculature.â€ This means you can pay attention to specific muscles and areas of the body, something that can be hard to do with larger weights.  </p>
<p>The accessibility of ankle weights also makes them useful, Folkard adds. â€œYou can throw them on during a pilates class or take them off if your body isnâ€™t asking for more in that moment,â€ she says. That might mean popping on your ankle weights for the moves youâ€™ve mastered but want to improve on, and then slipping them off for the moves youâ€™re a bit shaky on.Â Â </p>
<h2>How to use ankle weights to supercharge your workoutÂ </h2><h3>1. Counteract the impact of desk-based work </h3>
<p>Sitting at a desk for most of the day can lead to weakened muscles, especially in the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/best-hip-stretches-how-to-stretch-hips-flexors-workouts/369293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hip flexors</a>. But ankle weights are a great tool for undoing some of this effect.  </p>
<p>â€œPerforming a leg raise in a seated, standing or lying position can help to strengthen our hip flexors while providing a challenge for our core too,â€ says Natalie Holmes, a personal trainer at <a href="https://www.fitandfoodpt.co.uk/meet-the-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fit And Food PT</a>. â€œDead bugs, bicycle crunch and plank with knee drives â€“ all with weights around the ankle â€“ are great exercises to challenge the core too.â€Â </p>

<h3>2. Up your heart rate during cardio sessions </h3>
<p>Ankle weights arenâ€™t just great for building strength; theyâ€™re ideal for getting your blood pumping, too. You may not notice the extra weight at first, but the added effort builds up over time. </p>
<p>â€œWearing ankle weights during cardio activities like walking, jogging or aerobic exercises increases intensity,â€ Malik explains. â€œThis helps to improve cardiovascular endurance and adds a challenge to traditional cardio routines.â€</p>
<p>If you donâ€™t fancy a full-on cardio workout, wearing ankle weights <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/does-housework-count-as-exercise/815710#:~:text=About%2060%20minutes%20of%20cleaning,on%20top%20of%20the%20cleaning." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as you do some chores around the house</a> can also increase the intensity of the movement and elevate your heart rate a little higher than normal.Â </p>
<h3>3. Build muscle across the body </h3>
<p>Doing any kind of activity which builds strength while wearing ankle weights will supercharge the workout by adding increased resistance. Strapping them on during a bodyweight routine â€“ such as pilates â€“ can be especially beneficial, Folkard adds. </p>
<p>â€œDoing a pilates side series with weights on your leg will challenge pelvic stability, as the abs have to work hard to hold the pelvis in place,â€ she explains. â€œRaising the leg from the hip also activates the side glute, which is an important stabiliser for functional movement and is often the key to decreasing lower back pain.â€ </p>

<h3>4. Make your balance and stability training more challenging </h3>
<p><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/improve-balance-exercises-tips/797385" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Balance and stability training</a> may not be the most exciting area of exercise out there, but itâ€™s incredibly beneficial. Using ankle weights during these workouts will help to boost your progress and improve your bodily awareness, Malik adds.  </p>
<p>â€œPerforming balance exercises like standing leg lifts or single-leg squats with ankle weights challenges proprioception and improves balance and stability, while also strengthening the lower body muscles,â€ he says.Â </p>
<h3>5. Use them to activate your muscles before a workout </h3>
<p><a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/glute-activation-warm-up-strength-training/472784" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activating your muscles before you work out</a> â€“ to wake them up and get them working correctly â€“ can make a big difference to your ability to hold correct form and perform well.</p>
<p>Using a pair of ankle weights is a great way to do this, Holmes suggests. â€œWhile ankle weights may not provide enough stimulus to build strength past a certain point for those who are more experienced, they are still a great option for activation prior to a workout.â€</p>
<p>Ankle weights are particularly helpful when activating the glutes, which is important for maintaining strong and stable hips. â€œTo make sure the glutes kick in when theyâ€™re supposed to, you can use ankle weights to do kneeling or standing single-leg kickbacks and abductions,â€ Holmes adds.Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While fruit and vegetables are obviously good for us, how we eat them matters. We know, for example, that boiling broccoli into a brown goo is a surefire way to strip it of most of its vitamins. But what about actually making food more <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nutritious</a>?</p>
<p>â€˜Bioavailabilityâ€™ is a buzzword thatâ€™s become increasingly common. A favourite topic among <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/is-biohacking-the-new-way-forward-in-fitness/360213" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">biohacking</a> enthusiasts and nutritional professionals, increasing the bioavailability of food means making their vitamins and nutrients easier to absorb. While lots of plants are packed with antioxidants, theyâ€™re not always user-friendly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kale is a good example. Itâ€™s packed with vitamin A, K and B5, as well as potassium, copper and manganese. But grab a piece without any preparation and you may find it impossible to digest â€“ which is why we talk of the need to â€˜massageâ€™ the kale. By rubbing ultra-fibrous kale with olive oil, the leaves become easier to chew and digest without the need for cooking.Â </p>
<p>Add a squeeze of lemon juice or some vinegar, and you start to break down the cellulose in kale which again, will reduce the risk of indigestion while keeping all the health benefits intact (and adding a punch of vitamin C into the mix).

<div class="iframely-instagram iframely-app iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="A post shared by the kosher foodies (@kosherfoodies)" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/ReBvuTB?maxheight=1200&app=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The question is: are there any big health benefits to be had from concentrating on increasing bioavailability and if so, what other hacks should we be employing?</p>
<p>â€œWhile eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day is great, we should always ensure that we are maximising the number of nutrients we can receive from our diet,â€ says James Brady, qualified nutrition coach at <a href="https://origympersonaltrainercourses.co.uk/?gclid=CjwKCAiA7dKMBhBCEiwAO_crFLg_7hvSDE1LXovdJJm9zpSR8Ctn3mwSvrzZja5oq1oYsSH6FgeRkhoCgnAQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origym Centre of Excellence</a>.Â </p>
<h2>Why bother making foods more bioavailable?</h2><p>â€œAs our body canâ€™t make nutrients itself, we can only obtain them from food and not receiving enough may result in disease and deficiency,â€ Brady explains. That means trying to eat as much locally-sourced fruit and veg raw as possible. If you donâ€™t like raw veg, steaming is a great way of retaining many of the nutrients as you cook. However, if you want to max out the nutrient profile of your food, Brady confirms that â€œbaking or roasting results in a greater loss of nutrients because of the high temperatures required to do thisâ€.</p>
<p>â€œOur food is made up of complex chemical structures, which interact with one other as well as with our gut microbes and our cells,â€ explains Dr Federica Amati, nutritionist and scientist at Zoe.</p>
<p>She says that the most important thing to consider when it comes to nutrition is eating colourful plants at every opportunity as doing so is â€œone of the simplest ways to ensure fibre and polyphenol diversity which are key for good gut health and immune functionâ€.</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Eating 30 plants a week should be our aim if we're looking at our diets as a form of preventative healthcare." src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/11/17172316/fruits-and-veggies-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>â€œThis can come from seasonal fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds or from dozens of herbs and spices that you can add for extra flavour,â€ she says. She suggests adding mixed herbs to scrambled eggs, sticking frozen berries into a pot of overnight oats, adding a handful of mushrooms to a stir fry or blending your own pesto using basil, nuts and extra virgin olive oil (youâ€™ll also need either pecorino or nutritional yeast for that cheesy element).â€</p>
<p>The aim, she says,  is to have <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/30-plants-a-week-challenge/541085" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30 different plants per week</a>. By opting for a plants-first approach that includes going for dried spices, olive oil, whole grains, nuts and seasonal veggies, youâ€™re going to automatically consume a variety of prebiotic fibre and polyphenols that ensure a healthy, diverse gut microbiome.</p>
<h2>9 hacks for boosting the nutrient profile of common foods</h2><h3>Crush garlic to release antioxidants</h3>
<p>â€œCrushing and chopping onion and garlic releases an enzyme called alliinase that helps form the nutrient allicin,â€ Brady says. â€œWhen this nutrient is consumed, it may protect us against disease by forming other compounds.â€</p>
<p>While most academic studies look at the impact of taking garlic supplements on health, itâ€™s largely the allicin that is thought to offer health benefits. In fresh garlic, itâ€™s only fleetingly present â€“ just after the clove has been cut or crushed. A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25153873/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 review</a> published in the journal <i>Molecules</i> found that the compound has a variety of health-promoting properties such as lowering cholesterol and blood pressure and has been found to kill antibiotic resistant strains of the MRSA bug as well as cancer cells.Â </p>
<h3>Refrigerate vegetables to keep them powerful</h3>
<p>Brady says that oxygen, light and heat can all cause nutrient loss in plants. Itâ€™s important therefore to store all vegetables that arenâ€™t of the root variety in the fridge until you need them. Think of it this way: if youâ€™d roast them, theyâ€™re probably better stored somewhere dark and dry and if youâ€™d eat them fresh, they belong in the fridge.Â </p>
<h3>Soak grains to build strong bones</h3>
<p>Soaking beans and grains reduces the intake of phytic acid. Brady says that doing so can â€œpotentially stop the absorption of calcium, zinc, and magnesiumâ€. Too much phytic acid, he says, can weaken bones, induce stomach cramps and cause headaches.</p>
<h3>Cook carrots for healthy organs and skin </h3>
<p>â€œCooking carrots improves beta carotene absorption,â€ says Dr Amati. A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14673607/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comparative study</a>, published in the <i>European Journal of Nutrition</i>, looked at the difference in beta carotene availability in cooked, pureed and raw, chopped carrots. Researchers found that significantly more beta-carotene was absorbed from meals containing cooked, pureed carrots than from meals containing the raw stuff.Â Â </p>

<h3>Watch what you drink your coffee with</h3>
<p>Dr Amati warns against eating <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/eggs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eggs</a> alongside <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/caffeine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caffeine</a>, as doing so apparently impedes micronutrient absorption. But itâ€™s not just eggs that might become less nutritious with your morning latte.  </p>
<p>The tannates in coffee also make it <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5998341/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">harder to benefit from plant-based (non-heme) iron</a>, which you get from soy products, chickpeas and nuts.&nbsp;Caffeine can also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8360789/#:~:text=Oral%20doses%20of%20caffeine%20increase,blocked%20by%20adenosine%20receptor%20agonists" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boost the amount of calcium you excrete in your urine</a>&nbsp;(which means having less available to strengthen your bones). All of this doesnâ€™t mean that you absolutely need to <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/cutting-coffee-caffeine-month/583848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cut out coffee</a> at breakfast but if youâ€™re already anaemic, vitamin D deficient or looking to simply boost your mineral absorption, it might be worth having your coffee before or after a meal.</p>
<h3>Pair your eggs with avocado</h3>
<p>Pair fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K with small portions of dietary fats to help your body dissolve and absorb them, Brady advises. That means, for example, having a few slices of avocado with your eggs benedict.</p>
<h3>Drizzle lemon juice on spinach to unlock the iron</h3>
<p>Pairing vitamin C-rich citrus or peppers with iron-rich plants like lentils, kale and spinach can aid nutrient absorption. A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6940487/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a> in the <i>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</i> explains that animal-based iron doesnâ€™t usually need much help with being put to use, but that non-heme iron sources (plants) are aided by the ascorbic acid found in citrus, which it calls a â€œpowerful enhancer of nonheme iron absorptionâ€ which can â€œreverse the inhibiting effect of substances such as tea.â€&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Go for sourdough over regular bread for more iron</h3>
<p>â€œChoose sourdough over regular bread to enhance iron absorption,â€ advises Signe Svanfeldt, nutritionist at <a href="https://lifesum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lifesum</a>. Again, itâ€™s all to do with that pesky phytic acid: â€œWhen the (sour) dough is fermented, it breaks down the phytic acid that exists in whole grains, which makes it easier for the body to absorb the iron.â€Â Â </p>
<h3>Choose omelettes for a calcium punch</h3>
<p>Svanfeldt flags that in order to get a big vitamin D boost (crucial as we move through winter), we might want to pair vitamin D-rich foods like eggs and salmon with calcium like dairy and leafy greens. Thatâ€™s because vitamin D activates calcium absorption. Some milks may be fortified with vitamin D (and calcium if youâ€™re a plant milk drinker) so thatâ€™s a hole in one, but otherwise, omelette or scrambled eggs with milk and spinach is super nutritious.Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Letâ€™s be honest, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/healthy-nutritious-food-store-cupboard-essentials-quick-easy-meal-ideas/382196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-prepared foods</a> have been having a hard time lately. You donâ€™t have to search too hard to find information about how harmfulÂ <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/are-processed-foods-bad/611752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ultra-processed foods</a> can be, and it makes the weekly shop a bit of a minefield.Â </p>
<p>And when you think about <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/healthy-food" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthy food</a>, itâ€™s likely that dips and spreads donâ€™t immediately spring to mind â€“ but they can be a useful and nutritious addition to your larder.Â </p>
<p>While weâ€™d all love to have the time to create <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/recipes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delicious and varied dishes</a> every night at home, the reality is that most of us have times when we need to reach for something quick and easyÂ â€“ and thatâ€™s where condiments and spreads can add a dollop of flavour to elevate the simplest of dishes.Â </p>
<p>The good news is that you really donâ€™t have to make all these from scratch to reap the benefits â€“ itâ€™s entirely possible to have quality processed items without compromising on <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nutritional value</a>Â if you know where to look.Â Â </p>
<p>So in the spirit of ease, we asked nutritionists for their favourite must-have condiments and spreads that they always have in their store cupboards to add flavour and interest to their food. Here are nine you can slather, squeeze and spread to your heartâ€™s content.Â </p>
<h2>1. Nut butter</h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Peanuts and nut butter" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2024/03/05170127/gettyimages-610743562-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It probably wonâ€™t surprise you to learn that the nutritionists were unanimous in their love forÂ <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/peanut-butter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nut butters</a>. And while there are options loaded with salt and sugar, itâ€™s really easy to find good quality versions. </p>
<p>â€œI love almond, peanut and cashew butters,â€ says nutritionist <a href="https://www.gqjordannutrition.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ Jordan.</a> â€œThey provide a healthy dose of fats and protein supporting heart health, stabilising blood sugar, and supporting muscle and nerve function thanks to their vitamin and mineral content. For a healthier fix, always go for products made from 100% nuts with no added sugar.â€</p>
<h2>2. Kimchi</h2><p>If youâ€™re yet to try this traditional Korean spicy, fermented veggie dish, youâ€™re missing out. Not only does it pack a real punch, flavour-wise, adding depth and sour notes to all kinds of dishes, but itâ€™s great for <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/gut" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gut health</a>, too. </p>
<p>â€œA big dollop of kimchi makes an excellent replacement for hot sauce,â€ advises nutritional therapist <a href="https://www.alexallannutrition.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Allan</a>. â€œIt gives a kick of spice without the sugar. Plus, if you get an unpasteurised version, itâ€™s teeming with <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/starving-gut-bacteria/662090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good bacteria</a>, making it an excellent choice for gut health, lowering cholesterol and boosting immune tolerance.â€</p>
<h2>3. TahiniÂ </h2><p>Tahini is a real winner, nutritionally speaking. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34707227/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studies</a> show that the nutrient-dense ground sesame seed paste can help to lower blood pressure (although itâ€™s worth noting that the studies have only been conducted on males), while being an excellent plant-based source of protein. </p>
<p>â€œTahini really lovely nutty flavour to dishes and dips, and can be used to thicken sauces,â€ says registered nutritionist <a href="https://wholefoodwarrior.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva Humphries</a>. â€œHealth-wise, itâ€™s a great source of key minerals including calcium, iron and magnesium.â€</p>
<h2>4. Pesto</h2><p>Not simply a staple for tired parents everywhere, pesto is a rich source of antioxidants and healthy fats which can promote heart health, reduce inflammation and supply the body with essential nutrients.</p>
<p>â€œWhether homemade or store-bought, pesto often has a lineup of wholesome ingredients that offer numerous health benefits,â€ says functional health coach <a href="https://www.wegotthis.coach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jodi Montlake</a>.Â </p>
<p>â€œBoth delicious and healthful, pesto is packed full of nutrients. Basil is an excellent source of vitamin K, essential for blood clotting and bone formation, while pine nuts provide a rich source of vitamin E, helping to protect against chronic diseases and boost immunity.</p>
<p>â€œMeanwhile, the extra virgin olive oil and parmesan cheese aid in the absorption of dietary fats, enhancing the bodyâ€™s utilisation of nutrients.â€
	  </p>
<h2>5. GuacamoleÂ </h2><p>â€œFor those of us struggling to get extra veg into our diets, guacamole can come to the rescue,â€ says Allan. â€œThis makes a perfect condiment to spicy dishes like chilli and fajitas, but you can also have it alongside salads. Itâ€™s easy to make, so donâ€™t rely on the additive-laden shop-bought ones.Â </p>
<p>â€œAvocados are a great source of fibre plus theyâ€™re high in folate. Adding onions, garlic, lime juice, fresh coriander, cumin and tomatoes not only adds to the flavour but helps us get to our <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/nutrition/eating-over-30-plants-6-month/799551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20-40 plant foods per week</a> for optimal gut health.â€Â </p>
<p>A real winner.</p>
<h2>6. MarmiteÂ Â </h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Pots of marmite" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2024/03/06171624/marmite-1120x1120.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Love it or hate it, Marmite has a myriad of nutritional benefits.Â </p>
<p>â€œThis yeast extract, made from leftover brewersâ€™ yeast, has good levels of B vitamins and minerals such as magnesium and calcium,â€ says nutritionist <a href="https://www.hhopenutrition.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hannah Hope</a>.Â </p>
<p>â€œB vitamins are great for your energy and protect your nervous system, while the minerals provide other health benefits such as sleep support. Itâ€™s also gluten-free and vegetarian so can appeal to many on special diets, even if you arenâ€™t a marmite fan, and you can add a tablespoon to many dishes (such as chilli) to enhance the flavour and you wonâ€™t taste a thing!â€</p>
<h2>7. KetchupÂ </h2><p>In excellent news for all of us, everyoneâ€™s favourite dip has some surprising health benefits. </p>
<p>â€œWhile ketchup may have gained a less-than-ideal reputation, its primary ingredient (tomato) offers potential health benefits worth considering,â€ agrees Montlake.Â </p>
<p>â€œTomatoes are a nutritional powerhouse. Notably, they contain the carotenoid lycopene, which <a href="yhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8626194/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> suggests possesses anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic properties. Some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9741066/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies</a> have also linked lycopene to cancer prevention and cognitive support â€“ just be sure to choose a version lower in sugar and salt for optimum health benefits.â€
	  </p>
<h2>8. TzatzikiÂ </h2><p>A Greek yoghurt-based dip, tzatziki offers probiotics for gut health and protein for muscle repair.</p>
<p>â€œKnown for its antibacterial properties and fibre content, garlic supports gut health, clears mucus from the lungs and sinuses, and provides selenium, an essential mineral,â€ says Montlake.Â </p>
<h2>9. Harissa</h2><p>If youâ€™re not familiar with this north African red chilli paste, it offers a subtle yet rich flavour to dishes. If youâ€™re making it yourself, you can make it as fiery or mild as you like. The jarred paste is versatile and lends a tasty kick to shakshuka, veggies or chicken recipes.Â </p>
<p>â€œThe capsaicin in this spicy chilli paste can support your metabolism, helping you burn energy more efficiently,â€ says Allan. â€œThe paste also has anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce pain and swelling.â€</p>

			<description>Always looking for the next goal to tick off? You might be addicted to achievement. Expert Dr Mandy Lehto explains how to tellÂ â€“ and how to thrive in spite of it.Â </description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everybody likes reaching their <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/spring-reset-new-years-resolutions-goals/775333" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goals</a>. Whether itâ€™s the fanfare that comes from buying a house or the buzz of finally securing that promotion, thereâ€™s nothing more satisfying than fulfilling something youâ€™ve always aimed for. But can there ever be too much of a good thing, where our desire to achieve turns into something closer to addiction? According to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mandylehto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Mandy Lehto</a>, an executive coach and the host of <i>Enough, The Podcast</i>, the answer is yes. </p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s entirely possible to become addicted to behaviours, and achievement is a potent drug that is positively reinforced and often celebrated by society,â€ she explains.</p>
<p>Defined as the over-consumption of work (or other goal-focused pursuits) even when it has a negative effect on our own wellbeing or the wellbeing of others, achievement addiction often looks like a compulsive need to tick things off a list, hit goals, gather external accolades and relentlessly produce at the expense of simply being. Sound at all familiar? Youâ€™re far from alone.</p>
<p>As an executive coach, Dr Lehto says that she sees a lot of similarities in the types of people who come to her with achievement addiction. â€œThey are often go-getting Type As who love to win and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/how-to-relax-tips-switching-off/449551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">struggle to relax</a>,â€ she shares.Â â€œPeople who are addicted to achievement are usually very future-focused, constantly moving towards an imagined ideal because the present isnâ€™t really working as they want it to.</p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s a need to have something to strive towards whether thatâ€™s an event, a package from Asos or completing a goal.  If you feel afraid of ordinariness, you might be addicted to achievement.â€</p>
<p> However, itâ€™s important to remember that none of us are immune to addiction. â€œWe live in a very â€˜addictogenicâ€™ world that constantly encourages us to chase dopamine through social media validation, endless consumption and 24/7 stimulation,â€ she adds.Â </p>
<h2>How to spot the signs of achievement addiction</h2><p>According to Dr Lehto, one of the signs of achievement addiction is the loss ofÂ <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/setting-work-boundaries-out-of-office/632254" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boundaries</a>Â when it comes to work (if thatâ€™s where youâ€™re getting your achievement fix).</p>
</p>
<p>â€œYou might find yourself sending emails at 3am or working on holiday â€“ perhaps secretly,â€ she shares. â€œThereâ€™s no â€˜offâ€™ button; all conversations and thoughts revolve around work, but you might get tetchy and defensive if others mention it as an issue. But it really becomes a problem when it starts to have an adverse effect on your mental health, physical health and relationships.â€</p>
</p>
<p>Another sign of achievement addiction is that everything becomes about productivity, even hobbies and reading for leisure.  Everything you do becomes a lever for optimising yourself and hitting goals â€“ you might find yourself using your â€˜downtimeâ€™ to consume personal development books and train for a marathon.Â </p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>
<img class="pp-media__image" alt="Success dumping: â€œMy friendâ€™s incessant bragging is making me feel inadequate â€“ what can I do?â€" src="https://images-stylist.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2022/07/29143442/gettyimages-948480478-crop-1659101722-1280x1280.jpg">
<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>â€œThere is often a sense that even when you do reach the pinnacle of achievement, it still doesnâ€™t feel â€˜enoughâ€™,â€ Dr Lehto explains. â€œAchievement addicts might really be addicted to anticipation and striving.  To the hope that this time the reality is going to match the expectation. Then a deep disappointment follows if it doesnâ€™t. Youâ€™re left with the feeling of never being satiated and a compulsive need to look for the next â€˜thingâ€™â€¦ again.â€</p>
<h2>How to deal with achievement addiction</h2><p>To work on achievement addiction, Dr Lehto stresses the importance of recalibrating your relationship with the present. â€œNot everything is supposed to be exceptional and extraordinary.  Learning to be here, in the present moment, is the first step,â€ she says. â€œThere is loveliness and joy to be found in everyday moments.  The more we can appreciate these and resist the urge to rush towards an imagined pot of gold on the horizon, the more balance and contentment we will experience.â€ Whatâ€™s more, itâ€™s important to remember that if we put all our eggs in the basket of achievement, weâ€™re neglecting other aspects of our lives, such as connection, relationships, rest and wellbeing.Â </p>
<p>Ultimately, we need to create distance from overachieving behaviours. â€œItâ€™s helpful to run little experiments to see how changing certain behaviours over a few weeks makes you feel,â€ Dr Lehto advises. This could mean setting boundaries around work where you leave on time and donâ€™t check emails on your phone after 6pm or before 8am, or spend a month filling your leisure time with hobbies and activities that bring you joy, instead of ones that â€˜improveâ€™ you.  </p>
<p>â€œIf youâ€™re addicted to achievement, itâ€™s not really about making money, gaining accolades and gathering praise â€“ it means a deeper need is going unmet,â€ she adds. â€œIn all likelihood that need is connection.  Thatâ€™s why support can also be so helpful, whether itâ€™s a support group, a therapist or a coach.â€Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting plenty of folic acid is vital during pregnancy, which is why <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/folic-acid/how-and-when-to-take-folic-acid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the NHS recommends</a> women who are pregnant or trying to conceive take a 400mg folic acid supplement daily. But did you know that folic acid â€“ also known as folate or vitamin B9 â€“ is something all of us should be consuming? </p>
<p>According to a new survey by <a href="https://www.discovergreatveg.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discover Great Veg</a>, one in five of us think pregnant women are the only people who need folate, with 75% of us being unaware that folate can be found naturally in food. </p>
<p>Itâ€™s hardly surprising, then, that <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/ndns-results-from-years-9-to-11-2016-to-2017-and-2018-to-2019/ndns-results-from-years-9-to-11-combined-statistical-summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the latest National Diet and Nutrition Survey report</a> showed that levels of folate (of which folic acid is just one form) in the UK diet are not as high as they should be, with average blood folate concentrations decreasing by 25-28% over the last 11 years across all age groups. Thatâ€™s concerning because vitamin B9 plays a crucial role in red blood cell formation and healthy cell growth and function.Â Â </p>
<p>In fact, a vitamin B9 deficiency has been <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamin-b12-or-folate-deficiency-anaemia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linked to outcomes</a> ranging from tiredness and fatigue to anaemia and mental health issues including depression and anxiety. And in the long-term, eating a folate-deficient diet <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamin-b12-or-folate-deficiency-anaemia/complications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has also been linked</a> to cardiovascular issues and even cancer. </p>
<p>So, how can you get more of the stuff? <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-b/#:~:text=Adults%20need%20200%20micrograms%20of,eat%20folate%2Dcontaining%20foods%20frequently." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The NHS recommends we get 200mg of folate every day</a>, but there are plenty of ways to bring more vitamin B9 into your diet: for example, dark leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale contain 194ug and 141ug of folate per 100g respectively. Other folate-rich food sources include chickpeas, kidney beans, broccoli and brussels sprouts.</p>
<p>There are, of course, plenty of ways to cook with spinach, kale and other folate-rich food sources, but to get you started, <a href="https://www.lunchboxdoctor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nutritionist Jenny Tschiesche</a> has partnered with Discover Great Veg to create three delicious recipes packed full of folate and other essential nutrients. Check them out below.Â Â </p>
<h2>Spinach and kale mini quiches</h2><figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>

<p><b>Serves:</b> 8</p>
<p><b>Prep time:</b> 10 minutes</p>
<p><b>Cooking time:</b> 25 minutes</p>
<p><i>Each portion (two quiches) contains 30% of your daily recommended folate requirement.Â You will need an 8-hole muffin baking tray â€“ each muffin hole should have at least a 125ml capacity.</i></p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>90g spinach</li>
<li>90g kale</li>
<li>3 tbsp water</li>
<li>6 large eggs</li>
<li>180g fresh pesto</li>
<li>Ground black pepper</li>
<li>A little olive oil for greasing</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 190ÂºC. Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat and add the spinach, kale and water. Cook for a few minutes until the leaves have wilted and reduced. Leave to cool. Pop these leaves into your food processor and blend on medium speed.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, beat the eggs with the pesto and pepper then add to the cooled leaves in the food processor before blending on top speed.</li>
<li>Grease the eight holes of your muffin tin with a little oil or use cases to avoid sticking. Fill each of the eight greased muffin holes with equal amounts of the eggy mixture. Put the tray in the oven and cook for 20-25 minutes or until a cocktail stick inserted into the quiches comes out clean.</li>

			<description>I had the same hair style for 25 years, but when I finally got my hair cut into a blunt bob, I let go of all of my hair insecurities and halved my morning routine too.</description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since a particularly savage haircut in my first year of secondary school (my first experience of layers and above-the-shoulders-length hair), I have exercised extreme caution at the hairdressers. Iâ€™ve asked for nothing more than a trauma-free trim for over 25 years and have existed with a basic, easy, midi-length haircut that hasnâ€™t changed and has suited me just fine.Â </p>
<p>With the meteoric rise of the bob, however, I started seeing inspiration everywhereÂ â€“ from Gigi Hadidâ€™s new beachy <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/bob-hairstyle-inspiration-celebrities/135149" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bob</a> to Sydney Sweeneyâ€™s <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hollywood-bob-haircut/829866" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood bob</a>Â â€“ and started to question just how fond I really was of my thin, lacklustre hairstyle that even my hairdresser has been politely suggesting that I should update.</p>
<p>Some of my absolute favourite bobs includeÂ <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C1b2LG3opcD/?igsh=YnVleXpyeDZvYzYz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Rutherford</a>â€™s sleek, preppy bob; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CuTmf9wIObG/?igsh=MTl6Nm1iZzdqOHdydw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura Jackson</a>â€™s undoneÂ <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/midi-bob-haircut/659834" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">midi bob</a>; Zendayaâ€™s elegant <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/french-bob-haircut-inspiration/414147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">French bob</a>; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvxdkYss_yc/?igsh=MTI1YTIybDZpbGJydA%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexis Foreman</a>â€™s cool, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/blunt-bob-haircut/707792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blunt shoulder-length bob</a>; Ambika Modâ€™s collarbone bob and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3kjqzUumRX/?igsh=MXAwYmFpY29uamp1OQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ayo Edebiri</a>â€™s versatile <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/bob-haircuts/685946" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chin-length bob</a>.</p>
<p>So, I decided to make the leap, book an appointment and get the haircut. I chose a hairdresser I respect (and who also cuts Laura Jacksonâ€™s hair) at a brilliant salon â€“ I wanted their advice and to feel confident that I could trust in the process.Â Formerly Luke Hershesonâ€™s assistant, Jordan G at Hershesons Fitzrovia has over 15 years of experience cutting and styling hair in London, LA, San Francisco and New York â€“ heâ€™s well known as the guy that gets you cool-girl hair.</p>
<div class="iframely-instagram iframely-app iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="A post shared by Laura Jackson (@iamlaurajackson)" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/I382ynx?maxheight=1200&app=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>With my inspirations spanning such a vast range of lengths and hair types, I thought it best not to bring photos or references, and instead to ask lots of questions and agree on a length I feel comfortable with after the consultation.Â </p>
<p>Jordan goes reasonably easy on me but also stands firm about the length. He explains: â€œWith any haircut, but especially with bobs, the length sets the tone. You can be the coolest chick in the world but if youâ€™ve got a dead-length haircut it just projects the wrong look, so Iâ€™ve got this rule: youâ€™ve got great zones and no-go zones and hair touching the shoulder is a no-go zone. You just end up with this weather girl flick thing. It doesnâ€™t look good.â€</p>
<p>He urges me to go for a shorter length than I was imagining, adding that â€œbobs look great with a clear gap between your hair and your shoulders. If you arenâ€™t going as short as that you should go for a <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/hair/collarbone-bob/687066" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collarbone bob</a>.â€</p>
<div class="iframely-instagram iframely-app iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="A post shared by Kelly Rutherford (@kellyrutherford)" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/RCT7Uhs?maxheight=1200&app=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>While Iâ€™m processing his advice he adds something that puts me at ease: â€œAs most peopleâ€™s hair is thicker closer to the root than the ends, cutting a bob will make your hair look way more dense. You have lots of hair, but individually itâ€™s fine, so I would never put layers in your hair.â€</p>
<p>I decide to go above the shoulder. In terms of styling, Jordan keeps it simple: he uses some Kerastase mousse to â€œmake it feel a bit thickerâ€ and then finishes with some Hershesons Almost Everything Cream, advising me to â€œapply it with your fingers acting like a comb to separate the hair up a bitâ€.</p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>

</figure>
<p>And thatâ€™s it. I now have a bob and it looks much better than I thought it would and nothing at all like the humbling haircut of 2001. It looks much thicker now, too. When I wash it, I leave it to dry naturally and it dries great â€“ the hallmark of a great cut â€“ and it cuts my morning routine in half too.Â

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever noticed that you get so much less work done when youâ€™re in the office? The <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/office-volume-wars-debate-magazine-issue387/630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">distracting background chatter</a>, the constant interruptions, the <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/pointless-meetings/790877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointless meetings</a> where you canâ€™t get away with typing as you listenâ€¦ it all seems to conspire against you and stops you from getting on with your tasks. And thatâ€™s if you have predominantly well-behaved, well-intentioned colleagues who donâ€™t send your blood pressure rocketing. Once you add in irritating co-workers, the office becomes the last place you want to be.Â </p>
<p>No wonder, then, that research from Indeed has found that more than a fifth of workers are deciding to work from home just to avoid sitting among their irritating co-workers. Indeed points to reduced tolerance for workplace irritation, noting that the pandemic and all that time working from home has made us more sensitive to the tribulations of being in the office.Â </p>
<p>But which behaviours drive us most around the bend? Is it the loud typing, the messy desks, the microwaved fish?Â </p>
<p>The research found that itâ€™s actually gossiping (annoying 34% of workers surveyed) that tops our irritation list, followed by swearing, flirting and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/friends-boss-oversharing-work/471442" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oversharing</a>. One in five of those surveyed reported hearing too much information from their co-workers every day they were in the office.Â </p>
<figure class='pp-media pp-media--pull-centre'>

<figcaption class="pp-media__caption">Getty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Of course, your colleagues can make you prickle even when youâ€™re not in the same physical space. Remote working faux pas mentioned in the survey included not responding to messages and emails, vaping or smoking on video calls and forgetting to mute or unmute. More than one in 10 employees experience the pain of digital <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/how-to-deal-with-a-micromanager-at-work/816275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">micromanaging</a>, with their co-workers monitoring when theyâ€™re online.Â </p>
<p>And regardless of being in the office, colleagues taking credit for our work irks 46% of us, while being talked over was listed as a major annoyance for 36% of those surveyed.Â </p>
<p>Danny Stacy, UK head of talent intelligence at Indeed, said: â€œOur data underlines the changing workplace behaviours over time, influenced by the huge shift caused by the pandemic with more employees working remotely. There are always going to be colleagues with habits that frustrate us and some behaviours that are simply unacceptable in the workplace. But whatâ€™s important for employers is to create moments of connection for employees, no matter where theyâ€™re based, to maintain relationships and ensure environments where everyone can do their best work.</p>
</p>
<p>â€œAccording to our research, over half (55%) of workers say being able to behave informally (within reason) at work makes them enjoy their job more, while 41% agree that experiencing behaviour thatâ€™s informal but still professional in an interview would make them more likely to take a job. For employers, itâ€™s about striking that balance between employees feeling like they can be themselves, while maintaining a professional working environment where all colleagues feel comfortable.â€</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Itâ€™s an especially great day for millennial women, and thatâ€™s not just because the sun is shining and iced coffee season is nearly here. One of the UKâ€™s most iconic writers, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/books/best-jacqueline-wilson-books-ranked/405459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jacqueline Wilson</a>, has revealed that sheâ€™s publishing a new sequel, <i>Think Again</i>, in her <i>Girls </i>series â€“ nearly 30 years after the first one was released back in 1997.</p>
<p>For many, Wilson represented a typical 00s childhood with <i>Tracy Beaker </i>on TV after school, battered copies of <i>Lola Rose </i>passed around friendship groups and sleepovers hosted with the sole aim of dissecting the teenage messiness of Ellie, Nadine and Magda.</p>
<p>The original four-part <i>Girls </i>series started in 1997 with <i>Girls In Love</i>, followed by <i>Girls Under Pressure</i> (1998), <i>Girls Out Late</i> (1999) and <i>Girls In Tears</i> (2002). Now, over 20 years after the fourth book, we get to dive back into the world of Ellie, Nadine and Magda as they navigate the chaos of adulthood.</p>
<div class="iframely-instagram iframely-app iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="Jacqueline Wilson on Instagram: &quot;We are thrilled to announce that the adult sequel to the beloved Girls quartet, Think Again, is coming this September! ðŸ’•  Revisit Ellie, Magda and Nadine, now aged 40, and see how their lives have changedâ€¦  Head to the link in the bio to pre-order your copy now âœ¨&quot;" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/45sMd1y?maxheight=1200&app=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The synopsis reads: â€œBeing an adult isnâ€™t quite what Ellie Allard dreamed it would be when she was 14 years old. Though sheâ€™s got her beautiful daughter Lottie, lifelong best friends Magda and Nadine and her trusty cat Stella, her love life is non-existent and she feels like sheâ€™s been living on auto-pilot, just grateful to be able to afford the rent on her pokey little flat.</p>
<p>But this year, on her birthday, the universe seems to decide itâ€™s time for all that to change â€“ whether Ellie wants it to or not. As she navigates new, exciting and often choppy waters, sheâ€™s about to discover that life will never stop surprising you â€“ if only you let it.â€</p>
<p>On the adult sequel, Wilson said: â€œIâ€™ve always wondered whatever happened to Ellie, Magda and Nadine, the teenagers in my <i>Girls </i>series. Iâ€™ve decided to find out what theyâ€™re up to nowadays. Itâ€™s been great fun writing for adults for a change. I think everyone reading <i>Think Again </i>will be surprised.â€</p>
<p>Itâ€™s safe to say weâ€™ll be counting down the days until we can grab a copy of <i>Think Again </i>to find out what happened to the girls all these years later, aged 40.</p>
<p><b><i>Think Again</i> will be published by Transworld in September 2024, while the <i>Girls </i>novels will be reissued by their original publisher, Penguin Random House.</b></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We know what youâ€™re thinking: <i>Why on earth are we talking about <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/film/christmas-movies-2024/841134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas films</a> when weâ€™re gripping onto the first days of spring</i>? Well, when Richard Curtis is behind a new festive film, we canâ€™t help but get excited. And thatâ€™s not to mention the stellar cast involved in the upcoming Netflix film.</p>
<p><i>That Christmas</i>, based on <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/4756/9780241393611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curtisâ€™s childrenâ€™s book series</a>, is being adapted for the screen by the author himself and will be an animated adventure like no other. So, hereâ€™s everything we know so far about <i>That Christmas</i>.</p>
<h2><b>What is the plot of <i>That Christmas</i>?</b></h2>
<p><i>That Christmas</i> follows a â€œseries of entwined tales about family and friends, love and loneliness, and Santa Claus making a big mistake â€“ not to mention an enormous number of turkeysâ€, reads the synopsis.</p>

</figure>
<h2><b>Who will star in <i>That Christmas</i>?</b></h2>
<p>The film stars Brian Cox as Santa, Fiona Shaw as Ms Trapper, Jodie Whittaker as Mrs Williams and Bill Nighy as Bill â€“ all residents of a charming seaside town where things turn upside down one Christmas.</p>
<p>Also starring are Lolly Adefope, Alex Macqueen, Katherine Parkinson, Sindhu Vee, India Brown, Zazie Hayhurst, Sienna Sayer, Jack Wisniewski, Rosie Cavaliero, Paul Kaye, Guz Khan, Andy Nyman, Kuhu Agarwal, Bronte Smith, Freddie Spry, Ava Talbot and Rhys Darby.</p>
<p>On the Netflix adaptation, Curtis said: â€œThis has been the most amazing adventure, my first animated film. Itâ€™s been especially exciting to see the whole world I imagined come to life beyond my wildest dreams â€“ and populated by a dream bunch of actors, their wonderful voices turned into such rich and funny characters.â€</p>
<h2><b>When will <i>That Christmas</i> be released?</b></h2>
<p>The film will drop on Netflix later this year, likely around the festive season.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, weâ€™re saying it â€“ forget quiet luxury â€“ low-maintenance luxury is officially the trend to tap into this year.</p>
<p>And when it comes to our tresses, the skinification of hair, science-backed formulas and luxe yet low-effort haircuts are all on our radar as top 2024 haircare trends.</p>
<p>Weâ€™re looking to invest our money wisely, swerve the â€˜buy cheap, buy twiceâ€™ trap and turn to haircare heroes that are truly proven to transform our locks.</p>
<p>So, if youâ€™re looking to get the luxe look at home, we spoke to the experts to create the ultimate guide to low-maintenance luxury: here are the cuts, colours, products and regimes you need in your lifeâ€¦</p>

<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>â€˜The Rachelâ€™ definitely springs to mind when we explore the haircut trends for 2024. Yes, weâ€™re ready for a 90s revival.Â </p>
<p>â€œIn my salon Iâ€™ve had a lot of clients coming in looking for Georgia Steel from <i>Love Island</i>-inspired â€˜bangsâ€™ and lots of 90s face-framing layers,â€ says salon owner, <a href="https://www.rebeccacarr.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebecca Carr</a>.Â </p>
<p>With minimal day-to-day styling needed with already face-framing locks, itâ€™s the perfect cut to ask for if youâ€™re after a luxe look that requires little effort. </p>
<p>What other haircuts are the pros predicting to be big for 2024?</p>
<p>â€œThe lob â€“ aka, the long bob â€“ is low-maintenance luxury done right and a big hair trend for 2024,â€ says Frazer Sexton,Â stylist and educator at <a href="https://hookerandyoung.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hooker & Young Salon Group</a>.Â </p>
<p>Effortlessly cool, with minimal upkeep, itâ€™s a luxe style thatâ€™s easy to maintain. </p>
<p>â€œIf you prefer to keep your hair long, weâ€™re also seeing luxe long hair with texture and layers for 2024,â€ says Anthony Cooke, salon manager at <a href="https://brownsugar.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brown Sugar Dublin</a>. â€œThink â€˜beachyâ€™ â€“ this trend allows hair to be more natural.â€Â </p>

<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p><i>Stylist</i> asked pro-stylist and content creatorÂ <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chloeswiftstylist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChlÃ¶e Swift</a> which haircare drop sheâ€™s most excited about for 2024 and she recommended <a href="https://www.lookfantastic.com/brands/kerastase/premiere.list?utm_source=Stylist&utm_medium=dirbuy_display&utm_content=ker_haca_aw_display_aw&utm_campaign=ker_hair_ppd-kerastase_premiere-q1-24-stylist-partnerships__h1_nonpharma_&utm_term=standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PremiÃ¨re</a>, a new decalcifying, damage-repair range from <a href="https://www.lookfantastic.com/brands/kerastase/premiere.list?utm_source=Stylist&utm_medium=dirbuy_display&utm_content=ker_haca_aw_display_aw&utm_campaign=ker_hair_ppd-kerastase_premiere-q1-24-stylist-partnerships__h1_nonpharma_&utm_term=standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KÃ©rastase</a>. </p>
<p>â€œWe know that hair damage can occur due to things like bleaching, colouring and heat styling, but new research by KÃ©rastase has found that the calcium in our water could be amplifying damage of already delicate, over-processed hair, so if youâ€™re finding your locks are permanently tired, this could be why,â€ she tells <i>Stylist</i>. </p>
<p>KÃ©rastaseâ€™s <a href="https://www.lookfantastic.com/brands/kerastase/premiere.list?utm_source=Stylist&utm_medium=dirbuy_display&utm_content=ker_haca_aw_display_aw&utm_campaign=ker_hair_ppd-kerastase_premiere-q1-24-stylist-partnerships__h1_nonpharma_&utm_term=standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new PremiÃ¨re range</a> is one to get truly excited about â€“ because it uses an advanced, science-backed formula, this dual-action haircare range repairs from the inside out, restoring hairâ€™s original strength*.</p>

</p>
<p>â€œThe range contains up to 3% citric acid which is fantastic for hair and is known to trap and eliminate the excess calcium build-up, while reducing dullness and bringing back incredible shine,â€ says Swift.  </p>
<p>â€œThen we have up to 5% glycine, an amino acid, which is known to penetrate the cortex â€“ the inner layer of the hair â€“ and can help to reconnect broken keratin links, reducing breakage and strengthening strands.â€</p>

<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>â€œChampagne tones on hair that errs on the blonder side can be a super-easy way to luxe up your locks, and give that â€˜expensive blondeâ€™ feel to the hair,â€ Sexton tells <i>Stylist</i>. </p>
<p>â€œA soft root tap of colour in your chosen tone can help enhance your eye colour and skin tone, and ensure a low-maintenance hairstyle.â€ </p>
<p>â€œLived-in blonde is having a real moment, and is super-easy to maintain,â€ says Carr. â€œWhether itâ€™s honey blonde or Bambi blonde, these tones are big trends for 2024.â€ </p>
<p>â€œBalayage is super low-maintenance in terms of colour, and itâ€™s still holding the trends,â€ says Cooke. â€œIf you donâ€™t want all-out colour, itâ€™s a great way to give a sun-kissed, natural feel to your look.â€ </p>
<p>If you want to add dimension and a luxe feel to your hair, while still allowing you to go longer between appointments, ask for a balayage next time you get the itch to change up your look.</p>

<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>We all know that conditioner follows shampoo, but thereâ€™s so much more to consider when it comes to keeping your hair in top condition â€“ and itâ€™s important to follow a low-maintenance yet effective routine for maximum results. </p>
<p>â€œLayering haircare products, just like in skincare, can help active ingredients to penetrate deeper, for even better results,â€ says Cooke.</p>
<p>For ChlÃ¶e Swift, <a href="https://www.lookfantastic.com/brands/kerastase/premiere.list?utm_source=Stylist&utm_medium=dirbuy_display&utm_content=ker_haca_aw_display_aw&utm_campaign=ker_hair_ppd-kerastase_premiere-q1-24-stylist-partnerships__h1_nonpharma_&utm_term=standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KÃ©rastaseâ€™s</a> new-for-2024 <a href="https://www.lookfantastic.com/brands/kerastase/premiere.list?utm_source=Stylist&utm_medium=dirbuy_display&utm_content=ker_haca_aw_display_aw&utm_campaign=ker_hair_ppd-kerastase_premiere-q1-24-stylist-partnerships__h1_nonpharma_&utm_term=standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PremiÃ¨re regime</a> is the easiest way to get the luxe look at home. </p>
<p>â€œI really love how the PremiÃ¨re range involves layering steps, like you would with your skincare products,â€ she says. </p>
<p>It doesnâ€™t have to be a complicated routine to get maximum effects, either. â€œFirstly, you apply the <a href="https://www.lookfantastic.com/kerastase-premiere-decalcifying-repairing-pre-shampoo-treatment-250ml/15056955.html?utm_source=Stylist&utm_medium=dirbuy_display&utm_content=ker_haca_aw_display_aw&utm_campaign=ker_hair_ppd-kerastase_premiere-q1-24-stylist-partnerships__h1_nonpharma_&utm_term=standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decalcifying pre-shampoo treatment</a> onto damp hair and allow it to sit on the lengths and ends for five minutes,â€ says Swift.</p>
<p class="">â€œThen, layer with the <a href="https://www.lookfantastic.com/kerastase-premiere-decalcifying-system-reparative-shampoo-250ml/15056954.html?utm_source=Stylist&utm_medium=dirbuy_display&utm_content=ker_haca_aw_display_aw&utm_campaign=ker_hair_ppd-kerastase_premiere-q1-24-stylist-partnerships__h1_nonpharma_&utm_term=standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decalcifying repairing shampoo</a> which cleanses, but also maximises the efficacy of the pre-treatment â€“ rinse out and then end with the <a href="https://www.lookfantastic.com/kerastase-premiere-anti-rigidity-decalcifying-repairing-conditioner-200ml/15056947.html?utm_source=Stylist&utm_medium=dirbuy_display&utm_content=ker_haca_aw_display_aw&utm_campaign=ker_hair_ppd-kerastase_premiere-q1-24-stylist-partnerships__h1_nonpharma_&utm_term=standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repairing conditioner</a>.â€</p>

<div class="listicle__paragraph"><p>Just like your skin, your hair will benefit from different care focuses at different times of the day.Â </p>
<p>In the morning â€“ when youâ€™re most likely to use heat and styling products â€“ youâ€™ll want to take steps to protect your hair.</p>
<p>Come evening, when you may have more time on your hands, you can apply a hair oil or an overnight mask, so your locks can benefit from a nourishing overnight routine.Â </p>
<p>ChlÃ¶e Swift always recommends an AM and PM low-maintenance routine for your hair, to achieve that luxe look at home.</p>
<p>â€œAt night, Iâ€™ll apply a serum to lengths and ends, loosely braid my hair and sleep on a silk pillowcase to minimise hair friction and breakage when sleeping,â€ she tells <i>Stylist</i>. </p>
<p>â€œIf I know Iâ€™m washing my hair in the morning, Iâ€™ll go in with <a href="https://www.lookfantastic.com/kerastase-premiere-anti-breakage-reparative-filler-mask-200ml/15056956.html?utm_source=Stylist&utm_medium=dirbuy_display&utm_content=ker_haca_aw_display_aw&utm_campaign=ker_hair_ppd-kerastase_premiere-q1-24-stylist-partnerships__h1_nonpharma_&utm_term=standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this luxe hair mask</a>Â before braiding my hair â€“ it has the most incredible citrus scent which makes going to bed feel like a luxury â€“ and youâ€™ll see ultimate hydration and softness by morning.â€Â </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring is finally here, and now that the sun has started to come out again after another long, dark winter, we want to celebrate that in any way we can, whether thatâ€™s from <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/spring-cleaning-reset-psychology/651308" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spring cleaning</a> or taking <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/walking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long walks</a> in the evening sunshine (remember that?).</p>
<p>When it comes to our beauty choices, that goes double, with bright, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/spring-nail-trends-2022/632718" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">colourful manicures</a>Â one of the easiest and most fun ways to ring in the new season.Â </p>
<p>As nail artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iramshelton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iram Shelton</a>Â tells<i> Stylist</i>: â€œWeâ€™re going to be seeing lots of colour and playful nail combos. Thereâ€™s something different about this year, and it just screams fun to me. I think weâ€™ve mastered the art of the nude nail, but spring and summer is when we bring back the pops of colour.â€</p>
<div class="iframely-instagram iframely-app iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="Jenni Draper on Instagram: &quot;HydraDrops ðŸ’§   Donâ€™t forget to keep your cuticles hydrated ðŸ’¦   @personailityuk   #naturalnails #naturalnailcare #nails #personaility #hydradrops&quot;" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/cl5eplb?maxheight=1200&app=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2>Pastel pink</h2>
<p>â€œOf course a pastel pink is always a good idea,â€ says celebrity beauty and nail specialist <a href="https://www.jennidraper.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenni Draper</a>. â€œApply one or two thin coats for a natural, clean look and build the coats for a more opaque â€˜finishedâ€™ look. Add a frosted top coat for an apres ski-style shimmery finish. Skieuse from Chanel is the perfect buildable soft pink and, of course, Essieâ€™s Ballet Slippers.â€</p>
<div class="iframely-instagram iframely-app iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="Iram Shelton on Instagram: &quot;Naked nails with some âœ¨ perfect for all year round.  @opinailsuk bubble bath &amp; chrome powder  Nails prepped with @officialnavyprofessional  #nakednails #chromenails #opinailsuk #naturalnails #shortnails #gelnails #opiambassador&quot;" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/fW3s06U?maxheight=1200&app=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2>Shimmering shades</h2>
<p>Shelton, anÂ <a href="https://www.opi.com/en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OPI</a>Â global ambassador, says: â€œShimmers are in and here to stay, so I canâ€™t wait to see the layering of shimmers and chromes to create different finishes to the nail. The glazed effect will be in full force.â€</p>
<div class="iframely-instagram iframely-app iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="JASMIN on Instagram: &quot;@pantone peach fuzz x valentines ðŸ‘ðŸ¤âœ¨ swipe for the final look ðŸ‘‰ðŸ»  created for @flaconi.de using regular nail polish ðŸ«¶ðŸ»  base: @kikomilano Nude Rose peach: @alessandrointernational Ice Cream white: @nailberry_ flocon top: @essie gel setter  ring: @shopgirlscrew ðŸ’  ad â€¢ paid to create â€¢ no obligation to post â€¢ gifted products  #nails #nailart #nailinspo #pantone #pantonechallenge #pantone2024 #peachfuzz #peachnails #valentines #valentinesnails #heartnails #naildeesign #nailpolish #nailtutorial #nailinspiration #diynails #nagellack #nÃ¤gel Pantone Color of the year peach fuzz valentines nail art inspo polish nagellack design tutorial french tips&quot;" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/YwQ78Mt?maxheight=1200&app=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2>Peach fuzz</h2>
<p>Draper, whoâ€™s the founder of <a href="https://personaility.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PersoNAILity</a>, says: â€œWeâ€™ll be seeing peach hues making an appearance this spring. Pantoneâ€™s colour of the year is <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/home/pantone-2024-colour-of-the-year-peach-fuzz/848515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peach fuzz</a>, and this coincides nicely with spring. Look for soft peaches with slight pink tones. If you prefer a brighter colour, then the more orange shades will lead you nicely from spring into the warmer months. (Taylor Swift wore a peach shade with a squoval shape to an American football game not so long ago.) Try Gucciâ€™s 414â€‹ Peggy Sunburnâ€‹ or Vernis Ã  Ongles for an orangey/peach shade.â€</p>

<p>Shelton says: â€œ<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/negative-space-nail-designs/616983" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Negative space nails</a>Â always have a moment, particularly when people donâ€™t want <i>a lot </i>of colour but still want a little something that screams spring.â€</p>
<div class="iframely-instagram iframely-app iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive"><iframe title="Jenni Draper on Instagram: &quot;Love this colour â€˜Always Rightâ€™ (sounds familiar ðŸ˜‰) from @artisticnaildesign from @louellabelle ðŸ’œ . . . . #nails #nailstagram #nailswag #nailsoftheday #nailsart #nailsalon #nailstyle #nails2inspire #nailsdesign #nailsdid #nailsdone #nailsofig #nailsonfleek #nailshop #nailsoftheweek #nailstamping #nails4yummies #nailstylist #nailsfashion #nailsminsk #nailsgram #nailswagg #nailsinspiration #nails_page #nailstickers #nailsbeauty #nailsdesigns&quot;" data-iframely-url="https://embeds.stylist.co.uk/39WgXKV?maxheight=1200&app=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2>Lilac </h2>
<p>â€œSpring isnâ€™t spring without a lilac in the mix,â€ says Draper. â€œA lavender shade will give any outfit that pop of brightness that the spring months call for. Lilac suits most skin tones, and a sheer wash of lilac works well if you want to test the colour. But avoid blueish lilacs if your skin isnâ€™t â€˜warmâ€™ enough yet. My all-time favourite lilac is Chanel Immortelle 135 and OPIâ€™s Do You Lilac It?â€</p>

<p>â€œWe know animal prints are back,â€ Shelton says, â€œbut I expect to see some colourful variations on these designs this spring.â€</p>
